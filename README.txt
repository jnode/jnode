Welcome to JNode!

In this file, you find the instructions needed to setup a JNode development environment.

Sub-Projects
------------

JNode has been divided into several sub-projects in order to keep it "accessible". These sub-projects are:

JNode-All    The root project where everything comes together
JNode-Cli    Various command line commands
JNode-Core   The core java classes, the Virtual Machine, the OS kernel and the Driver framework
JNode-Distr  Tools and apps needed for a JNode "distribution"
JNode-FS     The Filesystems and the various block device drivers
JNode-GUI    The AWT implementation and the various video & input device drivers
JNode-Net    The Network implementation and the various network device drivers
JNode-Shell  The Command line shell and several system commands
JNode-Sound  Future work
JNode-Textui Text based AWT interface

Each sub-project has the same directory structure:

<subprj>/build       All build results 
<subprj>/descriptors All plugin descriptors
<subprj>/lib         All sub-project specific libraries
<subprj>/src         All sources 
<subprj>/.classpath  The eclipse classpath file
<subprj>/.project    The eclipse project file
<subprj>/build.xml   The Ant buildfile
<subprj>/build-tests.xml The Ant buildfile for running all tests of this subproject

Eclipse
-------

JNode is usually developed in Eclipse. (It can be done without)
The various sub-projects must be imported into eclipse. Since they reference each other, it is advisably to import them all at the same time
using Import -> Existing projects into workspace.

Building
--------

Execute:

On Windows:  build.bat cd-x86-lite
On Linux:    build.sh cd-x86-lite

Or in Eclipse, execute the "cd-x86-lite" target of all/build.xml.

The build will result in the following files:

all/build/cdroms/jnode-x86-lite.iso         bootable CD image
all/build/cdroms/jnode-x86-lite.iso.vmx     VMWare configuration file

Running
-------

On VMWare: Open all/build/cdroms/jnode-x86-lite.iso.vmx and click Start.
On Linux:  qemu.sh
