 * An immutable representation of a sequential number range.

 * A number range uses two number of values to denote points of
 * positive and negative infinity. By default, these values are
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE respectively. If start
 * or end are equal to or beyond the infinity values, then the
 * range is considered to be infinite in that direction.
 *
 * It is worth noting that the Comparable interface is sensitive
 * to the points of positive and negative infinity. Two number ranges
 * can have different start and end points and be considered equal if
 * both ranges are also infinite in that direction.
