/**
 * This subclass of <code>FilterInputStream</code> buffers input from an

 * <p>
 * This class also implements mark/reset functionality.  It is capable
 * of remembering any number of input bytes, to the limits of
 * system memory or the size of <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>
 * <p>
 * Please note that this class does not properly handle character
 * encodings.  Consider using the <code>BufferedReader</code> class which
 * does.
