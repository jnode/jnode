 * Object is the ultimate superclass of every class
 * (excepting interfaces).  When you define a class that
 * does not extend any other class, it implicitly extends
 * java.lang.Object.  Also, an anonymous class based on
 * an interface will extend Object.
 *
 * <p>It provides general-purpose methods that every single
 * Object, regardless of race, sex or creed, implements.
 * All of the public methods may be invoked on arrays or
 * interfaces.  The protected methods <code>clone</code>
 * and <code>finalize</code> are not accessible on arrays
 * or interfaces, but all array types have a public version
 * of <code>clone</code> which is accessible.

   * Determine whether this Object is semantically equal

   * <p>There are some fairly strict requirements on this
   * method which subclasses must follow:<br>
   * <ul>
   * <li>It must be transitive.  If <code>a.equals(b)</code> and
   *     <code>b.equals(c)</code>, then <code>a.equals(c)</code>
   *     must be true as well.</li>
   * <li>It must be symmetric.  <code>a.equals(b)</code> and
   *     <code>b.equals(a)</code> must have the same value.</li>
   * <li>It must be reflexive.  <code>a.equals(a)</code> must
   *     always be true.</li>
   * <li>It must be consistent.  Whichever value a.equals(b)
   *     returns on the first invocation must be the value
   *     returned on all later invocations.</li>
   * <li><code>a.equals(null)</code> must be false.</li>
   * <li>It must be consistent with hashCode().  That is,
   *     <code>a.equals(b)</code> must imply
   *     <code>a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()</code>.
   *     The reverse is not true; two objects that are not
   *     equal may have the same hashcode, but that has
   *     the potential to harm hashing performance.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This is typically overridden to throw a {@link ClassCastException}
   * if the argument is not comparable to the class performing
   * the comparison, but that is not a requirement.  It is legal
   * for <code>a.equals(b)</code> to be true even though
   * <code>a.getClass() != b.getClass()</code>.  Also, it
   * is typical to never cause a {@link NullPointerException}.
   *
   * <p>In general, the Collections API ({@link java.util}) use the
   * <code>equals</code> method rather than the <code>==</code>
   * operator to compare objects.  However, {@link java.util.IdentityHashMap}
   * is an exception to this rule, for its own good reasons.

   *     words, if <code>a.equals(b)</code> is true, then
   *     <code>a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()</code> must be as well.
   *     However, the reverse is not necessarily true, and two
   *     objects may have the same hashcode without being equal.</li>
   * <li>It must be consistent.  Whichever value o.hashCode()
   *     returns on the first invocation must be the value
   *     returned on all later invocations as long as the object
   *     exists.  Notice, however, that the result of hashCode may
   *     change between separate executions of a Virtual Machine,
   *     because it is not invoked on the same object.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Notice that since <code>hashCode</code> is used in
   * {@link java.util.Hashtable} and other hashing classes,
   * a poor implementation will degrade the performance of hashing
   * (so don't blindly implement it as returning a constant!). Also,
   * if calculating the hash is time-consuming, a class may consider
   * caching the results.

   * Thus you cannot rely on this method to always work.
   * For finer control over garbage collection, use references
   * from the {@link java.lang.ref} package.
   *
   * <p>Virtual Machines are free to not call this method if
   * they can determine that it does nothing important; for
   * example, if your class extends Object and overrides

   * usually unsuited for performing actions that must be

   * use defensive programming if it is to always work.
   *
   * <p>If an Exception is thrown from finalize() during garbage
   * collection, it will be patently ignored and the Object will
   * still be destroyed.
   *
   * <p>It is allowed, although not typical, for user code to call
   * finalize() directly.  User invocation does not affect whether

   * an object by making it reachable from normal code again.

   * specifically calls <code>super.finalize()</code>.

   *      is true</li>

   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>However, these are not strict requirements, and may
