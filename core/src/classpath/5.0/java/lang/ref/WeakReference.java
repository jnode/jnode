 * A weak reference will be cleared, if the object is only weakly
 * reachable.  It is useful for lookup tables, where you aren't
 * interested in an entry, if the key isn't reachable anymore.
 * <code>WeakHashtable</code> is a complete implementation of such a
 * table. <br>
 *
 * It is also useful to make objects unique: You create a set of weak
 * references to those objects, and when you create a new object you
 * look in this set, if the object already exists and return it.  If
 * an object is not referenced anymore, the reference will
 * automatically cleared, and you may remove it from the set. <br>
