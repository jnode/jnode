 * Interface for lists of objects that can be returned in sequence. Successive

 * As of Java 1.2, the Iterator interface provides the same functionality, but
 * with shorter method names and a new optional method to remove items from the
 * list. If writing for 1.2, consider using Iterator instead. Enumerations over
 * the new collections classes, for use with legacy APIs that require them, can
 * be obtained by the enumeration method in class Collections.
