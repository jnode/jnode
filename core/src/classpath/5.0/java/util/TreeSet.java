/**
 * This class provides a TreeMap-backed implementation of the SortedSet
 * interface. The elements will be sorted according to their <i>natural
 * order</i>, or according to the provided <code>Comparator</code>.<p>
 *
 * Most operations are O(log n), but there is so much overhead that this
 * makes small sets expensive. Note that the ordering must be <i>consistent
 * with equals</i> to correctly implement the Set interface. If this
 * condition is violated, the set is still well-behaved, but you may have
 * suprising results when comparing it to other sets.<p>
 *
 * This implementation is not synchronized. If you need to share this between
 * multiple threads, do something like:<br>
 * <code>SortedSet s
 *       = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet(...));</code><p>
 *
 * The iterators are <i>fail-fast</i>, meaning that any structural
 * modification, except for <code>remove()</code> called on the iterator
 * itself, cause the iterator to throw a
 * <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> rather than exhibit
 * non-deterministic behavior.
