/**
 * An abstract superclass for Classpath toolkits.
 *
 * <p>There exist some parts of AWT and Java2D that are specific to
 * the underlying platform, but for which the {@link Toolkit} class
 * does not provide suitable abstractions. Examples include some
 * methods of {@link Font} or {@link GraphicsEnvironment}. Those
 * methods use ClasspathToolkit as a central place for obtaining
 * platform-specific functionality.
 *
 * <p>In addition, ClasspathToolkit implements some abstract methods
 * of {@link java.awt.Toolkit} that are not really platform-specific,
 * such as the maintenance of a cache of loaded images.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread Safety:</b> The methods of this class may safely be
 * called without external synchronization. This also hold for any
 * inherited {@link Toolkit} methods. Subclasses are responsible for
 * the necessary synchronization.
