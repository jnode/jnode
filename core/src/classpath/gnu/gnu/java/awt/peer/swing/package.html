  <h1>Swing based AWT peers.</h1>
  <p>This package defines an abstract set of AWT peers that is based on Swing
    widgets. This can be used as an implementation base for peer implementors
    who don't have access to native widgets or who want to build a quick
    prototype of a peer set without implementing all of the AWT widgets.
  </p>
  <p>An actual implementation would have to provide the following:
  <ul>
  <li>A concrete implementation of {@link java.awt.Toolkit}, possibly based
    on {@link SwingToolkit}. This implementation must provide all the missing
    methods of the <code>SwingToolkit</code>.</li>
  <li>Concrete implementations of {@link java.awt.peer.DialogPeer},
    {@link java.awt.peer.FramePeer} and {@link java.awt.peer.WindowPeer},
    ideally based on their <code>SwingXXXPeer</code> counterparts.
    Some methods must be specially
    overridden in those peers to provide useful functionality, like
    <code>getLocationOnScreen()</code>. See the API documentation for more
    details</li>
  <li>An implementation of {@link java.awt.Image}. These must be provided by
    the toplevel component peers.</li>
  <li>An implementation of {@link java.awt.Graphics}. This must also be
    provided by the toplevel peers.</li>
  <li>An implementation of {@link java.awt.Font}. This must be
    provided by the toolkit.</li>
  </ul>
