/**
 * <p>The basic visible methods of any symmetric key block cipher.</p>
 *
 * <p>A symmetric key block cipher is a function that maps n-bit plaintext
 * blocks to n-bit ciphertext blocks; n being the cipher's <i>block size</i>.
 * This encryption function is parameterised by a k-bit key, and is invertible.
 * Its inverse is the decryption function.</p>
 *
 * <p>Possible initialisation values for an instance of this type are:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>The block size in which to operate this block cipher instance. This
 *    value is <b>optional</b>, if unspecified, the block cipher's default
 *    block size shall be used.</li>
 *
 *    <li>The byte array containing the user supplied key material to use for
 *    generating the cipher's session key(s). This value is <b>mandatory</b>
 *    and should be included in the initialisation parameters. If it isn't,
 *    an {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown if any method, other than
 *    <code>reset()</code> is invoked on the instance. Furthermore, the size of
 *    this key material shall be taken as an indication on the key size in which
 *    to operate this instance.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</b>: Although all the concrete classes in this
 * package implement the {@link Cloneable} interface, it is important to note
 * here that such an operation <b>DOES NOT</b> clone any session key material
 * that may have been used in initialising the source cipher (the instance to be
 * cloned). Instead a clone of an already initialised cipher is another instance
 * that operates with the <b>same block size</b> but without any knowledge of
 * neither key material nor key size.</p>
