/**
 * <p>A variation of the SRP-6 protocol as used in the SASL-SRP mechanism, for
 * the User (client side).</p>
 *
 * <p>In this alternative, the exchange goes as follows:</p>
 * <pre>
 *    C -> S:  I                      (identifies self)
 *    S -> C:  N, g, s, B = 3v + g^b  (sends salt, b = random number)
 *    C -> S:  A = g^a                (a = random number)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>All elements are computed the same way as in the standard version.</p>
