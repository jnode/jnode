/**
 * <p>The basic visible methods of any MAC (Message Authentication Code)
 * algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <p>A <i>MAC</i> provides a way to check the integrity of information
 * transmitted over, or stored in, an unreliable medium, based on a secret key.
 * Typically, <i>MAC</i>s are used between two parties, that share a common
 * secret key, in order to validate information transmitted between them.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a <i>MAC</i> algorithm is based on a cryptographic hash function, it
 * is then called to a <i>HMAC</i> (Hashed Message Authentication Code) --see
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc-2104.txt">RFC-2104</a>.</p>
 *
 * Another type of <i>MAC</i> algorithms exist: UMAC or <i>Universal Message
 * Authentication Code</i>, described in
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-krovetz-umac-01.txt">
 * draft-krovetz-umac-01.txt</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>With <i>UMAC</i>s, the sender and receiver share a common secret key (the
 * <i>MAC</i> key) which determines:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>The key for a <i>universal hash function</i>. This hash function is
 *    <i>non-cryptographic</i>, in the sense that it does not need to have any
 *    cryptographic <i>hardness</i> property. Rather, it needs to satisfy some
 *    combinatorial property, which can be proven to hold without relying on
 *    unproven hardness assumptions.</li>
 *
 *    <li>The key for a <i>pseudorandom function</i>. This is where one needs a
 *    cryptographic hardness assumption. The pseudorandom function may be
 *    obtained from a <i>block cipher</i> or a <i>cryptographic hash function</i>.
 *    </li>
 * </ul>
