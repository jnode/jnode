/**
 * UncheckedRE is a subclass of RE that allows programmers an easier means
 * of programmatically precompiling regular expressions.  It is constructed
 * and used in exactly the same manner as an instance of the RE class; the
 * only difference is that its constructors do not throw REException.
 * Instead, if a syntax error is encountered during construction, a
 * RuntimeException will be thrown.
 * <P>
 * Note that this makes UncheckedRE dangerous if constructed with
 * dynamic data.  Do not use UncheckedRE unless you are completely sure
 * that all input being passed to it contains valid, well-formed 
 * regular expressions for the syntax specified.
