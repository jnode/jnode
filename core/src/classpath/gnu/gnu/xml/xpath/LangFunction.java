/**
 * The <code>lang</code> function returns true or false depending on whether
 * the language of the context node as specified by xml:lang attributes is
 * the same as or is a sublanguage of the language specified by the argument
 * string. The language of the context node is determined by the value of
 * the xml:lang attribute on the context node, or, if the context node has
 * no xml:lang attribute, by the value of the xml:lang attribute on the
 * nearest ancestor of the context node that has an xml:lang attribute. If
 * there is no such attribute, then lang returns false. If there is such an
 * attribute, then lang returns true if the attribute value is equal to the
 * argument ignoring case, or if there is some suffix starting with - such
 * that the attribute value is equal to the argument ignoring that suffix of
 * the attribute value and ignoring case.
