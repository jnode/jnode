/**
 * The <code>translate</code> function returns the first argument string
 * with occurrences of characters in the second argument string replaced by
 * the character at the corresponding position in the third argument string.
 * For example, translate("bar","abc","ABC") returns the string BAr. If
 * there is a character in the second argument string with no character at a
 * corresponding position in the third argument string (because the second
 * argument string is longer than the third argument string), then
 * occurrences of that character in the first argument string are removed.
 * For example, translate("--aaa--","abc-","ABC") returns "AAA". If a
 * character occurs more than once in the second argument string, then the
 * first occurrence determines the replacement character. If the third
 * argument string is longer than the second argument string, then excess
 * characters are ignored.
