/**
 * ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy defines a focus traversal order
 * based on the order in which Components were packed in a Container.
 * This policy performs a pre-order traversal of the Component
 * hierarchy starting from a given focus cycle root.  Portions of the
 * hierarchy that are not visible and displayable are skipped.
 *
 * By default, this policy transfers focus down-cycle implicitly.
 * That is, if a forward traversal is requested on a focus cycle root
 * and the focus cycle root has focusable children, the focus will
 * automatically be transfered down to the lower focus cycle.
 *
 * The default implementation of accept accepts only Components that
 * are visible, displayable, enabled and focusable.  Derived classes
 * can override these acceptance criteria by overriding accept.
