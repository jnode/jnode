/**
 * DefaultFocusTraversalPolicy is the default focus traversal policy
 * used by Containers.
 *
 * This policy sharpens ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy's
 * acceptance criteria, to reject those Components that have
 * unfocusable peers.  Despite this extra strictness, this policy will
 * always accept a Component that has explicitly been set focusable by
 * any means.
 *
 * This AWT implementation assumes that the peers of the following
 * Components are not focusable: Canvas, Panel, Label, ScrollPane,
 * Scrollbar, Window, and any lightweight Component.
 *
 * A Component's focusability is independent of the focusability of
 * its peer.
