/** This class implements a grid-based layout scheme.  Components are
 * all given the same size and are laid out from left to right and top
 * to bottom.  A GridLayout is configured with a number of rows and a
 * number of columns.  If both are specified, then the number of
 * columns is ignored and is derived from the number of rows and the
 * total number of components.  If either is zero then that dimension
 * is computed based on the actual size of the container.  An
 * exception is thrown if an attempt is made to set both the number of
 * rows and the number of columns to 0.  This class also supports
 * horizontal and vertical gaps; these are used as spacing between
 * cells.
