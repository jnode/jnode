/**
 * The <code>KeyboardFocusManager</code> handles the focusing of
 * windows for receiving keyboard events.  The manager handles
 * the dispatch of all <code>FocusEvent</code>s and
 * <code>KeyEvent</code>s, along with <code>WindowEvent</code>s
 * relating to the focused window.  Users can use the manager
 * to ascertain the current focus owner and fire events.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * The focus owner is the <code>Component</code> that receives
 * key events.  The focus owner is either the currently focused
 * window or a component within this window.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * The underlying native windowing system may denote the active
 * window or its children with special decorations (e.g. a highlighted
 * title bar).  The active window is always either a <code>Frame</code>
 * or <code>Dialog</code>, and is either the currently focused
 * window or its owner.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * Applets may be partitioned into different applet contexts, according
 * to their code base.  In this case, each context has its own
 * <code>KeyboardFocusManager</code>, as opposed to the global
 * manager maintained by applets which share the same context.
 * Each context is insulated from the others, and they don't interact.
 * The resulting behaviour, as with context division, depends on the browser
 * supporting the applets.  Regardless, there can only ever be
 * one focused window, one active window and one focus owner
 * per <code>ClassLoader</code>.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * To support this separation of focus managers, the manager instances
 * and the internal state information is grouped by the
 * <code>ThreadGroup</code> to which it pertains.  With respect to
 * applets, each code base has its own <code>ThreadGroup</code>, so the
 * isolation of each context is enforced within the manager.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * By default, the manager defines TAB and Ctrl+TAB as the
 * forward focus traversal keys and Shift+TAB and Ctrl+Shift+TAB
 * as the backward focus traversal keys.  No up or down cycle
 * traversal keys are defined by default.  Traversal takes effect
 * on the firing of a relevant <code>KEY_PRESSED</code> event.
 * However, all other key events related to the use of the
 * defined focus traversal key sequence are consumed and not
 * dispatched.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * These default traversal keys come into effect on all windows
 * for which no alternative set of keys is defined.  This also
 * applies recursively to any child components of such a window,
 * which define no traversal keys of their own.
