/**
 * This event is generated for a mouse wheel rotation. The wheel (the middle
 * mouse button on most modern mice) can be rotated towards or away from the
 * user, and is ofteh used for scrolling.
 *
 * <p>Because of the special use for scrolling components, MouseWheelEvents
 * often affect a different component than the one located at the point of
 * the event. If the component under the mouse cursor does not accept wheel
 * events, the event is passed to the first ancestor container which does. This
 * is often a ScrollPane, which knows how to scroll. If an AWT component is
 * built from a native widget that knows how to use mouse wheel events, that
 * component will consume the event.
 *
 * <p>The two most common scroll types are "units" (lines at a time) or
 * "blocks" (pages at a time). The initial setting is taken from the platform,
 * although the user can adjust the setting at any time.
