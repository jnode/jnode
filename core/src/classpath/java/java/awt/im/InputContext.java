/**
 * Provides a context for controlling input methods and keyboard layouts.
 * This class provides the communication layer between the client component,
 * and the various locale-dependent text entry input methods that can be used
 * for the client. By default, there is one instance per Window, shared among
 * all components, but this limits text entry to one component at a time.
 * Thus, text components can create their own instance to allow text entry
 * in multiple components at a time.
 *
 * <p>By using the interfaces of {@link java.awt.im.spi}, you can install
 * extensions which allow additional input methods. Some of these may use
 * platform native input methods, or keyboard layouts provided by the platform.
 * Input methods are unavailable if none have been installed and the platform
 * has no underlying native input methods. Extensions are installed as jar
 * files, usually accessed in the default extension location or specified by
 * the -extdir VM flag. The jar must contain a file named
 * "META_INF/services/java.awt.im.spi.InputMethodDescriptor" which lists,
 * one entry per line in UTF-8 encoding, each class in the jar that implements
 * java.awt.im.spi.InputMethodDescriptor.
