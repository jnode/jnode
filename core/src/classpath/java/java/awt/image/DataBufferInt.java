/* This is one of several classes that are nearly identical. Maybe we
   should have a central template and generate all these files. This
   is one of the cases where templates or macros would have been
   useful to have in Java.

   This file has been created using search-replace. My only fear is
   that these classes will grow out-of-sync as of a result of changes
   that are not propagated to the other files. As always, mirroring
   code is a maintenance nightmare.  */
