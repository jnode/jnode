/**
 * Beans implement this to get information about the execution environment and its services and to be placed in the hierarchy.
 * <P>
 *
 * The difference between a <code>BeanContext</code> and a
 * <code>BeanContextChild</code>, mainly, is that a
 * <code>BeanContext</code> may be a parent.
 * <P>
 *
 * <code>BeanContextChild</code> instances will be serialized at some
 * point in their life, but you need to make sure your bean context does
 * not contain a serializable reference (directly or indirectly) to the
 * parent <code>BeanContext</code>, to any of the other
 * <code>BeanContext</code>s in the tree, or to any resources obtained
 * via the <code>BeanContextServices</code> interface.  One way to do this
 * is to mark any fields that contain such references as
 * <code>transient</code>.  Another way is to use a custom serializer.
 * <P>
 *
 * If you do not do this, when the <code>BeanContext</code> is serialized,
 * all the other <code>BeanContext</code>s and other unnecessary things
 * will be serialized along with it.
 * <P>
 *
 * Before dying, a <code>BeanContextChild</code> should call
 * <code>getBeanContext().remove(this)</code> to detach from the
 * hierarchy and exit cleanly.

	 * Otherwise, nasty pathological recursion stuff could occur in
	 * certain situations.

	 * you made prior to the veto.  Best not to make any such changes
	 * prior to the veto in the first place.
