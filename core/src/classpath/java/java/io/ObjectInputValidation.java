/**
  * This class allows an object to validate that it is valid after
  * deserialization has run completely for it and all dependent objects.
  * This allows an object to determine if it is invalid even if all
  * state data was correctly deserialized from the stream.  It can also
  * be used to perform re-initialization type activities on an object
  * after it has been completely deserialized.
  *
  * Since this method functions as a type of callback, it must be 
  * registered through <code>ObjectInputStream.registerValidation</code>
  * in order to be invoked.  This is typically done in the
  * <code>readObject</code> method.
