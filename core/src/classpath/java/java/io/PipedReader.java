/**
  * An input stream that reads characters from a piped writer to which it is 
  * connected. 
  * <p>
  * Data is read and written to an internal buffer.  It is highly recommended
  * that the <code>PipedReader</code> and connected <code>PipedWriter</code>
  * be part of different threads.  If they are not, there is a possibility
  * that the read and write operations could deadlock their thread.
  *
  * @specnote The JDK implementation appears to have some undocumented 
  *           functionality where it keeps track of what thread is writing
  *           to pipe and throws an IOException if that thread susequently
  *           dies. This behaviour seems dubious and unreliable - we don't
  *           implement it.
