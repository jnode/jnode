   * If the first byte has a <code>1110</code> as its high order bits, then the
   * character consists of three bytes.  The bits that make up the character
   * value are in positions 0 through 3 of the first byte and bit positions
   * 0 through 5 of the other two bytes.  (The second and third bytes should
   * have <code>10</code> as their high order bits).  These values are in most
   * significant byte first (i.e., "big endian") order.
   * <p>
   * As an example, if <code>byte1</code> <code>byte2</code> 
   * and <code>byte3</code> are the
   * three bytes read, and the high order bits of them match the patterns
   * which indicate a three byte character encoding, then they would be

   * <p>
   * <code>(char)(((byte1 & 0x0F) << 12) | ((byte2 & 0x3F) << 6) | 
   * (byte3 & 0x3F))</code>

   * Note that all characters are encoded in the method that requires the
   * fewest number of bytes with the exception of the character with the
   * value of <code>&#92;u0000</code> which is encoded as two bytes.  This is 
   * a  modification of the UTF standard used to prevent C language style
   * <code>NUL</code> values from appearing in the byte stream.
