/**
 * An assertion error normally occurs as a result of the <code>assert</code>
 * statement added in JDK 1.4, to indicate that an assertion failed. There
 * are enough constructors to ensure that
 * <code>new AssertionError(<em>expression</em>)</code> will work for all
 * expressions, regardless of type, as if the error message were given by
 * the string <code>"" + <em>expression</em></code>. This extends Error,
 * because you usually do not want to inadvertently trap an assertion failure.
