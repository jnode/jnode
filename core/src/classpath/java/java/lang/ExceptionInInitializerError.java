/**
 * An <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code> is thrown when an uncaught
 * exception has occurred in a static initializer or the initializer for a
 * static variable. In general, this wraps only RuntimeExceptions, since the
 * compiler does not allow a checked exception to be uncaught in an
 * initializer. This exception only occurs during reflection, when a class
 * is initialized as part of another action.
