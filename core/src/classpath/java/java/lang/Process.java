/**
 * An instance of a subclass of <code>Process</code> is created by the
 * <code>Runtime.exec</code> methods.  Methods in <code>Process</code>
 * provide a means to send input to a process, obtain the output from a
 * subprocess, destroy a subprocess, obtain the exit value from a
 * subprocess, and wait for a subprocess to complete.
 *
 * <p>This is dependent on the platform, and some processes (like native
 * windowing processes, 16-bit processes in Windows, or shell scripts) may
 * be limited in functionality. Because some platforms have limited buffers
 * between processes, you may need to provide input and read output to prevent
 * the process from blocking, or even deadlocking.
 *
 * <p>Even if all references to this object disapper, the process continues
 * to execute to completion. There are no guarantees that the
 * subprocess execute asynchronously or concurrently with the process which
 * owns this object.
