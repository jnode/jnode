/**
 * ThreadLocal objects have a different state associated with every
 * Thread that accesses them. Every access to the ThreadLocal object
 * (through the <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods)
 * only affects the state of the object as seen by the currently
 * executing Thread.
 *
 * <p>The first time a ThreadLocal object is accessed on a particular
 * Thread, the state for that Thread's copy of the local variable is set by
 * executing the method <code>initialValue()</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>An example how you can use this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Connection
 * {
 *   private static ThreadLocal owner = new ThreadLocal()
 *     {
 *       public Object initialValue()
 *       {
 *         return("nobody");
 *       }
 *     };
 * ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Now all instances of connection can see who the owner of the currently
 * executing Thread is by calling <code>owner.get()</code>. By default any
 * Thread would be associated with 'nobody'. But the Connection object could
 * offer a method that changes the owner associated with the Thread on
 * which the method was called by calling <code>owner.put("somebody")</code>.
 * (Such an owner changing method should then be guarded by security checks.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>When a Thread is garbage collected all references to values of
 * the ThreadLocal objects associated with that Thread are removed.
 * </p>
