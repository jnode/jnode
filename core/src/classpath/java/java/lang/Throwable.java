/**
 * Throwable is the superclass of all exceptions that can be raised.
 *
 * <p>There are two special cases: {@link Error} and {@link RuntimeException}:
 * these two classes (and their subclasses) are considered unchecked
 * exceptions, and are either frequent enough or catastrophic enough that you
 * do not need to declare them in <code>throws</code> clauses.  Everything
 * else is a checked exception, and is ususally a subclass of
 * {@link Exception}; these exceptions have to be handled or declared.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are usually created with knowledge of the
 * execution context, so that you can get a stack trace of the problem spot
 * in the code.  Also, since JDK 1.4, Throwables participate in "exception
 * chaining."  This means that one exception can be caused by another, and
 * preserve the information of the original.
 *
 * <p>One reason this is useful is to wrap exceptions to conform to an
 * interface.  For example, it would be bad design to require all levels
 * of a program interface to be aware of the low-level exceptions thrown
 * at one level of abstraction. Another example is wrapping a checked
 * exception in an unchecked one, to communicate that failure occured
 * while still obeying the method throws clause of a superclass.
 *
 * <p>A cause is assigned in one of two ways; but can only be assigned once
 * in the lifetime of the Throwable.  There are new constructors added to
 * several classes in the exception hierarchy that directly initialize the
 * cause, or you can use the <code>initCause</code> method. This second
 * method is especially useful if the superclass has not been retrofitted
 * with new constructors:<br>
 * <pre>
 * try
 *   {
 *     lowLevelOp();
 *   }
 * catch (LowLevelException lle)
 *   {
 *     throw (HighLevelException) new HighLevelException().initCause(lle);
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Notice the cast in the above example; without it, your method would need
 * a throws clase that declared Throwable, defeating the purpose of chainig
 * your exceptions.
 *
 * <p>By convention, exception classes have two constructors: one with no
 * arguments, and one that takes a String for a detail message.  Further,
 * classes which are likely to be used in an exception chain also provide
 * a constructor that takes a Throwable, with or without a detail message
 * string.
 *
 * <p>Another 1.4 feature is the StackTrace, a means of reflection that
 * allows the program to inspect the context of the exception, and which is
 * serialized, so that remote procedure calls can correctly pass exceptions.
