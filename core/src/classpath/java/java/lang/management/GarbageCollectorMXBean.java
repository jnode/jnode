 * for removing unreferenced objects from memory.  A garbage
 * collector is a type of memory manager, so this interface
 * is combined with that of generic memory managers.  An instance
 * of this bean for each garbage collector is obtained by calling
 * {@link ManagementFactory#getGarbageCollectorMXBeans()}.
