 * this package.
 * </p>
 * <p> 
 * Creating a type variable requires resolving the appropriate type.
 * This may involve resolving other classes as a side effect (e.g.
 * if the type is nested inside other classes).  Creation should not
 * involve resolving the bounds.  Repeated creation has no effect; an
 * equivalent instance is returned.  Caching is not required, but all
 * instances must be <code>equal()</code> to each other.
