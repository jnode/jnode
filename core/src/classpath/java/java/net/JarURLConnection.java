/**
  * This abstract class represents a common superclass for implementations
  * of jar URL's.  A jar URL is a special type of URL that allows JAR
  * files on remote systems to be accessed.  It has the form:
  * <p>
 * jar:&lt;standard URL pointing to jar filei&gt;!/file/within/jarfile
  * <p> for example:
  * <p>
  * jar:http://www.urbanophile.com/java/foo.jar!/com/urbanophile/bar.class
  * <p>
  * That example URL points to the file /com/urbanophile/bar.class in the
  * remote JAR file http://www.urbanophile.com/java/foo.jar.  The HTTP
  * protocol is used only as an example.  Any supported remote protocol
  * can be used.
  * <p>
  * This class currently works by retrieving the entire jar file into a
  * local cache file, then performing standard jar operations on it.
  * (At least this is true for the default protocol implementation).
