/**
 * This class is used to model miscellaneous network permissions.  It is
 * a subclass of <code>BasicPermission</code>.  This means that it models a
 * "boolean" permission.  One that you either have or do not have.  Thus
 * there is no permitted action list associated with this object.
 *
 * The following permission names are defined for this class:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>setDefaultAuthenticator - Grants the ability to install a facility
 * to collect username and password information when requested by a
 * web site or proxy server.</li>
 * <li>requestPasswordAuthentication - Grants the ability to ask the
 * authentication facility for the user's password.</li>
 * <li>specifyStreamHandler - Grants the permission to specify the
 * stream handler class used when loading from a URL.</li>
 * </ul>
