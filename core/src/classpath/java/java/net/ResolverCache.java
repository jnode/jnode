/**
 * This class provides a cache of name service resolutions.  By
 * default successful resolutions are cached forever to guard
 * against DNS spoofing attacks and failed resolutions are cached
 * for 10 seconds to improve performance.  The length of time that
 * results remain in the cache is determined by the following
 * security properties:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><code>networkaddress.cache.ttl</code></dt>
 *   <dd>
 *     This property specifies the length of time in seconds that
 *     successful resolutions remain in the cache.  The default is
 *     -1, indicating to cache forever.
 *   </dd>
 *   <dt><code>networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</code></dt>
 *   <dd>
 *     This property specifies the length of time in seconds that
 *     unsuccessful resolutions remain in the cache.  The default
 *     is 10, indicating to cache for 10 seconds.
 *   </dd>
 * In both cases, a value of -1 indicates to cache forever and a
 * value of 0 indicates not to cache.
