 * This abstract class serves as the parent class for socket implementations.

 * A default implementation is provided by the system, but this can be
 * changed via installing a <code>SocketImplFactory</code> (through a call
 * to the static method <code>Socket.setSocketImplFactory</code>).  A
 * subclass of <code>Socket</code> can also pass in a <code>SocketImpl</code>
 * to the <code>Socket(SocketImpl)</code> constructor to use an
 * implementation different from the system default without installing
 * a factory.
