/**
 * <p>
 * The <code>Naming</code> class handles interactions with RMI registries.
 * Each method takes a URL in <code>String</code> form, which points to
 * the RMI registry.  The scheme of the URL is irrelevant.  The relevant
 * part is:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>//host:port/name</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * which tells the method how to locate and access the registry.  The host
 * and port are both optional, and default to `localhost' and the standard
 * RMI registry port (1099) respectively.  The name is simply a string
 * used to refer to a particular service hosted by the registry.  The
 * registry does not attempt to interpret this further.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * RMI services are registered using one of these names, and the same name
 * is later used by the client to lookup the service and access its methods. 
 * Registries can be shared by multiple services, or a service can create
 * its own registry using <code>createRegistry()</code>.
