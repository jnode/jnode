/**
 * <p>This is an abstract class for representing the system security policy for
 * a Java application environment (specifying which permissions are available
 * for code from various sources). That is, the security policy is represented
 * by a <code>Policy</code> subclass providing an implementation of the abstract
 * methods in this <code>Policy</code> class.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is only one <code>Policy</code> object in effect at any given time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The source location for the policy information utilized by the
 * <code>Policy</code> object is up to the <code>Policy</code> implementation.
 * The policy configuration may be stored, for example, as a flat ASCII file, as
 * a serialized binary file of the <code>Policy</code> class, or as a database.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The currently-installed <code>Policy</code> object can be obtained by
 * calling the <code>getPolicy()</code> method, and it can be changed by a call
 * to the <code>setPolicy()</code> method (by code with permission to reset the
 * <code>Policy</code>).</p>
 *
 * <p>The <code>refresh()</code> method causes the policy object to refresh /
 * reload its current configuration.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is implementation-dependent. For example, if the policy object stores
 * its policy in configuration files, calling <code>refresh()</code> will cause
 * it to re-read the configuration policy files. The refreshed policy may not
 * have an effect on classes in a particular {@link ProtectionDomain}. This is
 * dependent on the <code>Policy</code> provider's implementation of the
 * <code>implies()</code> method and the {@link PermissionCollection} caching
 * strategy.</p>
 *
 * <p>The default <code>Policy</code> implementation can be changed by setting
 * the value of the <code>"policy.provider"</code> security property (in the
 * Java security properties file) to the fully qualified name of the desired
 * <code>Policy</code> implementation class. The Java security properties file
 * is located in the file named <code>&lt;JAVA_HOME>/lib/security/java.security
 * </code>, where <code>&lt;JAVA_HOME></code> refers to the directory where the
 * SDK was installed.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:</b> This implementation attempts to read the
 * System property named <code>policy.provider</code> to find the concrete
 * implementation of the <code>Policy</code>. If/when this fails, it falls back
 * to a default implementation, which <b>allows everything</b>.
