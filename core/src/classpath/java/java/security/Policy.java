/**
 * <code>Policy</code> is an abstract class for managing the system security
 * policy for the Java application environment. It specifies which permissions
 * are available for code from various sources. The security policy is
 * represented through a subclass of <code>Policy</code>.
 * 
 * <p>Only one <code>Policy</code> is in effect at any time. A
 * {@link ProtectionDomain} initializes itself with information from this class
 * on the set of permssions to grant.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The location for the actual <code>Policy</code> could be anywhere in any
 * form because it depends on the Policy implementation. The default system is
 * in a flat ASCII file or it could be in a database.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The current installed <code>Policy</code> can be accessed with
 * {@link #getPolicy()} and changed with {@link #setPolicy(Policy)} if the code
 * has the correct permissions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The {@link #refresh()} method causes the <code>Policy</code> instance to
 * refresh/reload its configuration. The method used to refresh depends on the
 * <code>Policy</code> implementation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When a protection domain initializes its permissions, it uses code like
 * the following:</p>
 * 
 * <code>
 * policy = Policy.getPolicy();
 * PermissionCollection perms = policy.getPermissions(myCodeSource);
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>The protection domain passes the <code>Policy</code> handler a
 * {@link CodeSource} instance which contains the codebase URL and a public key.
 * The <code>Policy</code> implementation then returns the proper set of
 * permissions for that {@link CodeSource}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The default <code>Policy</code> implementation can be changed by setting
 * the "policy.provider" security provider in the "java.security" file to the
 * correct <code>Policy</code> implementation class.</p>
