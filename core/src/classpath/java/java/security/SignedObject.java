/**
 * <code>SignedObject</code> is used for storing runtime objects whose
 * integrity cannot be compromised without being detected.
 * 
 * <p><code>SignedObject</code> contains a {@link Serializable} object which is
 * yet to be signed and a digital signature of that object.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The signed copy is a "deep copy" (in serialized form) of an original
 * object. Any changes to that original instance are not reflected in the
 * enclosed copy inside this <code>SignedObject</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Several things to note are that, first there is no need to initialize the
 * signature engine as this class will handle that automatically. Second,
 * verification will only succeed if the public key corresponds to the private
 * key used to generate the digital signature inside this
 * <code>SignedObject</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For fexibility, the signature engine can be specified in the constructor
 * or the <code>verify()</code> method. Programmers wishing to verify
 * <code>SignedObject</code>s should be aware of the {@link Signature} engine
 * they use. A malicious or flawed {@link Signature} implementation may always
 * return true on verification thus circumventing the intended secrity check
 * provided by the <code>SignedObject</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The GNU security provider offers an implementation of the standard NIST
 * DSA which uses "DSA" and "SHA-1". It can be specified by "SHA/DSA",
 * "SHA-1/DSA" or its OID. If the RSA signature algorithm is provided then it
 * could be "MD2/RSA". "MD5/RSA", or "SHA-1/RSA". The algorithm must be
 * specified because there is no default.</p>
