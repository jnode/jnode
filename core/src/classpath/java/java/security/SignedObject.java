/**
 * <p><code>SignedObject</code> is a class for the purpose of creating authentic
 * runtime objects whose integrity cannot be compromised without being detected.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>More specifically, a <code>SignedObject</code> contains another
 * {@link Serializable} object, the (to-be-)signed object and its signature.</p>
 *
 * <p>The signed object is a <i>"deep copy"</i> (in serialized form) of an
 * original object. Once the copy is made, further manipulation of the original
 * object has no side effect on the copy.</p>
 *
 * <p>The underlying signing algorithm is designated by the {@link Signature}
 * object passed to the constructor and the <code>verify()</code> method. A
 * typical usage for signing is the following:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Signature signingEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
 * SignedObject so = new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey, signingEngine);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A typical usage for verification is the following (having received
 * <code>SignedObject</code> so):</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Signature verificationEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
 * if (so.verify(publickey, verificationEngine))
 *   try
 *     {
 *       Object myobj = so.getObject();
 *     }
 *   catch (ClassNotFoundException ignored) {};
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Several points are worth noting. First, there is no need to initialize the
 * signing or verification engine, as it will be re-initialized inside the
 * constructor and the <code>verify()</code> method. Secondly, for verification
 * to succeed, the specified public key must be the public key corresponding to
 * the private key used to generate the <code>SignedObject</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>More importantly, for flexibility reasons, the <code>constructor</code>
 * and <code>verify()</code> method allow for customized signature engines,
 * which can implement signature algorithms that are not installed formally as
 * part of a crypto provider. However, it is crucial that the programmer writing
 * the verifier code be aware what {@link Signature} engine is being used, as
 * its own implementation of the <code>verify()</code> method is invoked to
 * verify a signature. In other words, a malicious {@link Signature} may choose
 * to always return <code>true</code> on verification in an attempt to bypass a
 * security check.</p>
 *
 * <p>The signature algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard <i>DSS</i>,
 * using <i>DSA</i> and <i>SHA-1</i>. The algorithm is specified using the same
 * convention as that for signatures. The <i>DSA</i> algorithm using the
 * <i>SHA-1</i> message digest algorithm can be specified, for example, as
 * <code>"SHA/DSA"</code> or <code>"SHA-1/DSA"</code> (they are equivalent). In
 * the case of <i>RSA</i>, there are multiple choices for the message digest
 * algorithm, so the signing algorithm could be specified as, for example,
 * <code>"MD2/RSA"</code>, <code>"MD5/RSA"</code> or <code>"SHA-1/RSA"</code>.
 * The algorithm name must be specified, as there is no default.</p>
 *
 * <p>The name of the Cryptography Package Provider is designated also by the
 * {@link Signature} parameter to the <code>constructor</code> and the <code>
 * verify()</code> method. If the provider is not specified, the default
 * provider is used. Each installation can be configured to use a particular
 * provider as default.</p>
 *
 * <p>Potential applications of <code>SignedObject</code> include:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>It can be used internally to any Java runtime as an unforgeable
 *  authorization token -- one that can be passed around without the fear that
 *  the token can be maliciously modified without being detected.</li>
 *  <li>It can be used to sign and serialize data/object for storage outside the
 *  Java runtime (e.g., storing critical access control data on disk).</li>
 *  <li>Nested <i>SignedObjects</i> can be used to construct a logical sequence
 *  of signatures, resembling a chain of authorization and delegation.</li>
 * </ul>
