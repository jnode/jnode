/**
   The Certificate class is an abstract class used to manage 
   identity certificates. An identity certificate is a
   combination of a principal and a public key which is 
   certified by another principal. This is the puprose of 
   Certificate Authorities (CA).
   
   This class is used to manage different types of certificates
   but have important common puposes. Different types of 
   certificates like X.509 and OpenPGP share general certificate
   functions (like encoding and verifying) and information like
   public keys.
   
   X.509, OpenPGP, and SDSI can be implemented by subclassing this
   class even though they differ in storage methods and information
   stored.
