/**
  * This class represents a pre-computed series of bits representing a
  * <code>String</code> for under a particular <code>Collator</code>.  This
  * value may be compared bitwise against another <code>CollationKey</code>
  * representing a different <code>String</code> under the same
  * <code>Collator</code> in a manner than is usually more efficient than
  * using the raw <code>Collator</code> compare methods.  There is overhead
  * associated with calculating this value, so it is generally not
  * advisable to compute <code>CollationKey</code>'s unless multiple 
  * comparisons against a <code>String</code> will be done.  (For example,
  * in a sort routine).
  * <p>
  * This class cannot be instantiated directly.  Instead, a 
  * <code>CollationKey</code> is created by calling the
  * <code>getCollationKey</code> method on an instance of <code>Collator</code>.
