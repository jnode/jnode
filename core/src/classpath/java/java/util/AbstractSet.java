 * An abstract implementation of Set to make it easier to create your own

 * implement the same methods that are required for AbstractCollection
 * (although these methods must of course meet the requirements that Set puts
 * on them - specifically, no element may be in the set more than once). This
 * class simply provides implementations of equals() and hashCode() to fulfil
 * the requirements placed on them by the Set interface.
