/**
 * <p>
 * This class represents a specific time in milliseconds since the epoch.
 * The epoch is 1970, January 1 00:00:00.0000 UTC.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>Date</code> is intended to reflect universal time coordinate (UTC),
 * but this depends on the underlying host environment.  Most operating systems 
 * don't handle the leap second, which occurs about once every year or
 * so.  The leap second is added to the last minute of the day on either
 * the 30th of June or the 31st of December, creating a minute 61 seconds
 * in length.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The representations of the date fields are as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Years are specified as the difference between the year
 * and 1900.  Thus, the final year used is equal to
 * 1900 + y, where y is the input value.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Months are represented using zero-based indexing,
 * making 0 January and 11 December.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Dates are represented with the usual values of
 * 1 through to 31.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Hours are represented in the twenty-four hour clock,
 * with integer values from 0 to 23.  12am is 0, and
 * 12pm is 12.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Minutes are again as usual, with values from 0 to 59.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Seconds are represented with the values 0 through to 61,
 * with 60 and 61 being leap seconds (as per the ISO C standard).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Prior to JDK 1.1, this class was the sole class handling date and time
 * related functionality.  However, this particular solution was not
 * amenable to internationalization.  The new <code>Calendar</code>
 * class should now be used to handle dates and times, with <code>Date</code>
 * being used only for values in milliseconds since the epoch.  The
 * <code>Calendar</code> class, and its concrete implementations, handle
 * the interpretation of these values into minutes, hours, days, months
 * and years.  The formatting and parsing of dates is left to the
 * <code>DateFormat</code> class, which is able to handle the different
 * types of date format which occur in different locales.

   * <li>
   * A number preceded by a sign (+ or -) is taken to be a time zone
   * offset.  The time zone offset can be specified in either hours
   * or minutes.  The former is assumed if the number is less than 24.
   * Otherwise, the offset is assumed to be in minutes.  A - indicates
   * a time zone west of GMT, while a + represents a time zone to the
   * east of GMT.  The time zones are always assumed to be relative
   * to GMT, and a (redundant) specification of this can be included
   * with the time zone.  For example, '-9', 'utc-9' and 'GMT-9' all
   * represent a time zone nine hours west of GMT.  Similarly,
   * '+4', 'ut+4' and 'UTC+4' all give 4 hours east of GMT.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * A number equal to or greater than 70 is regarded as a year specification.
   * Values lower than 70 are only assumed to indicate a year if both the
   * day of the month and the month itself have already been recognised.
   * Year values less than 100 are interpreted as being relative to the current
   * century when the <code>Date</code> class is initialised..  Given a century,
   * x, the year is assumed to be within the range x - 80 to x + 19.  The value
   * itself is then used as a match against the two last digits of one of these
   * years.  For example, take x to be 2004.  A two-digit year is assumed to fall
   * within the range x - 80 (1924) and x + 19 (2023).  Thus, any intepreted value
   * between 0 and 23 is assumed to be 2000 to 2023 and values between 24 and 99
   * are taken as being 1924 to 1999.  This only applies for the case of 2004.
   * With a different year, the values will be interpreted differently. 2005
   * will used 0 to 24 as 2000 to 2024 and 25 to 99 as 1925 to 1999, for example.
   * This behaviour differs from that of <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> and is
   * time-dependent (a two-digit year will be interpreted differently depending
   * on the time the code is run).
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * Numbers followed by a colon are interpreted by first an hour, and then
   * as a minute, once an hour has been found.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * <li>
   * Numbers followed by a slash are regarded first as a month, and then as
   * a day of the month once the month has been found.  This follows the
   * U.S. date format of mm/dd, rather than the European dd/mm.  Months
   * are converted to the recognised value - 1 before storage, in order
   * to put the number within the range 0 to 11.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * Numbers followed by commas, whitespace, hyphens or the end of the string
   * are interpreted in the following order: hour, minute, second, day of month.
   * The first type not already recognised in the current string being parsed is
   * assumed.
   * </li>
   * </ul>
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * A sequence of consecutive alphabetic characters is recognised as a word,
   * and interpreted as follows, in a case-insentive fashion:
   * <ul>
   * <li>
   * The characters 'AM' or 'PM' restrict the hour value to a value between 0
   * and 12.  In the latter case, 12 is added to the hour value before storage.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * Any words which match any prefix of one of the days of the week ('Monday',
   * 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday' and 'Sunday'),
