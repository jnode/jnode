/**
 * <p>
 * This class represents the Gregorian calendar, that is used in most
 * countries all over the world.  It does also handle the Julian calendar
 * for dates smaller than the date of the change to the Gregorian calendar.
 * The Gregorian calendar differs from the Julian calendar by a different
 * leap year rule (no leap year every 100 years, except if year is divisible
 * by 400).  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This change date is different from country to country, and can be changed with
 * <code>setGregorianChange</code>.  The first countries to adopt the Gregorian
 * calendar did so on the 15th of October, 1582.  This date followed October
 * the 4th, 1582 in the Julian calendar system.  The non-existant days that were
 * omitted when the change took place are interpreted as Gregorian dates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Prior to the changeover date, New Year's Day occurred on the 25th of March.
 * However, this class always takes New Year's Day as being the 1st of January.
 * Client code should manually adapt the year value, if required, for dates
 * between January the 1st and March the 24th in years prior to the changeover.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any date infinitely forwards or backwards in time can be represented by
 * this class.  A <em>proleptic</em> calendar system is used, which allows
 * future dates to be created via the existing rules.  This allows meaningful
 * and consistent dates to be produced for all years.  However, dates are only
 * historically accurate following March the 1st, 4AD when the Julian calendar
 * system was adopted.  Prior to this, leap year rules were applied erraticly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two eras available for the Gregorian calendar, namely BC and AD.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Weeks are defined as a period of seven days, beginning on the first day
 * of the week, as returned by <code>getFirstDayOfWeek()</code>, and ending
 * on the day prior to this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The weeks of the year are numbered from 1 to a possible 53.  The first week
 * of the year is defined as the first week that contains at least the minimum
 * number of days of the first week in the new year (retrieved via
 * <code>getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()</code>).  All weeks after this are numbered
 * from 2 onwards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, take the year 2004.  It began on a Thursday.  The first week
 * of 2004 depends both on where a week begins and how long it must minimally
 * last.  Let's say that the week begins on a Monday and must have a minimum
 * of 5 days.  In this case, the first week begins on Monday, the 5th of January.
 * The first 4 days (Thursday to Sunday) are not eligible, as they are too few
 * to make up the minimum number of days of the first week which must be in
 * the new year.  If the minimum was lowered to 4 days, then the first week
 * would instead begin on Monday, the 29th of December, 2003.  This first week
 * has 4 of its days in the new year, and is now eligible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The weeks of the month are numbered from 0 to a possible 6.  The first week
 * of the month (numbered 1) is a set of days, prior to the first day of the week,
 * which number at least the minimum number of days in a week.  Unlike the first
 * week of the year, the first week of the month only uses days from that particular
 * month.  As a consequence, it may have a variable number of days (from the minimum
 * number required up to a full week of 7) and it need not start on the first day of
 * the week.  It must, however, be following by the first day of the week, as this
 * marks the beginning of week 2.  Any days of the month which occur prior to the
 * first week (because the first day of the week occurs before the minimum number
 * of days is met) are seen as week 0.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Again, we will take the example of the year 2004 to demonstrate this.  September
 * 2004 begins on a Wednesday.  Taking our first day of the week as Monday, and the
 * minimum length of the first week as 6, we find that week 1 runs from Monday,
 * the 6th of September to Sunday the 12th.  Prior to the 6th, there are only
 * 5 days (Wednesday through to Sunday).  This is too small a number to meet the
 * minimum, so these are classed as being days in week 0.  Week 2 begins on the
 * 13th, and so on.  This changes if we reduce the minimum to 5.  In this case,
 * week 1 is a truncated week from Wednesday the 1st to Sunday the 5th, and week
 * 0 doesn't exist.  The first seven day week is week 2, starting on the 6th.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * On using the <code>clear()</code> method, the Gregorian calendar returns
 * to its default value of the 1st of January, 1970 AD 00:00:00 (the epoch).
 * The day of the week is set to the correct day for that particular time.
 * The day is also the first of the month, and the date is in week 0.
 * </p>
