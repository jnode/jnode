/**
 * This class provides a hashtable-backed implementation of the
 * Map interface, but uses object identity to do its hashing.  In fact,
 * it uses object identity for comparing values, as well. It uses a
 * linear-probe hash table, which may have faster performance
 * than the chaining employed by HashMap.
 * <p>
 *
 * <em>WARNING: This is not a general purpose map. Because it uses
 * System.identityHashCode and ==, instead of hashCode and equals, for
 * comparison, it violated Map's general contract, and may cause
 * undefined behavior when compared to other maps which are not
 * IdentityHashMaps.  This is designed only for the rare cases when
 * identity semantics are needed.</em> An example use is
 * topology-preserving graph transformations, such as deep cloning,
 * or as proxy object mapping such as in debugging.
 * <p>
 *
 * This map permits <code>null</code> keys and values, and does not
 * guarantee that elements will stay in the same order over time. The
 * basic operations (<code>get</code> and <code>put</code>) take
 * constant time, provided System.identityHashCode is decent. You can
 * tune the behavior by specifying the expected maximum size. As more
 * elements are added, the map may need to allocate a larger table,
 * which can be expensive.
 * <p>
 *
 * This implementation is unsynchronized.  If you want multi-thread
 * access to be consistent, you must synchronize it, perhaps by using
 * <code>Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));</code>.
 * The iterators are <i>fail-fast</i>, meaning that a structural modification
 * made to the map outside of an iterator's remove method cause the
 * iterator, and in the case of the entrySet, the Map.Entry, to
 * fail with a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
