/**
 * A <code>ListResouceBundle</code> provides an easy way, to create your own
 * resource bundle. It is an abstract class that you can subclass. You should
 * then overwrite the getContents method, that provides a key/value list.
 *
 * <p>The key/value list is a two dimensional list of Object.  The first
 * dimension ranges over the resources. The second dimension ranges from
 * zero (key) to one (value). The keys must be of type String, and they are
 * case-sensitive. For example:
 *
<br><pre>public class MyResources
  extends ListResourceBundle
{
  public Object[][] getContents()
  {
    return contents;
  }

  static final Object[][] contents =
  {
    // LOCALIZED STRINGS
    {"s1", "The disk \"{1}\" contains {0}."},  // MessageFormat pattern
    {"s2", "1"},                       // location of {0} in pattern
    {"s3", "My Disk"},                 // sample disk name
    {"s4", "no files"},                // first ChoiceFormat choice
    {"s5", "one file"},                // second ChoiceFormat choice
    {"s6", "{0,number} files"}         // third ChoiceFormat choice
    {"s7", "3 Mar 96"},                // sample date
    {"s8", new Dimension(1,5)}         // real object, not just string
    // END OF LOCALIZED MATERIAL
  };
}</pre>
