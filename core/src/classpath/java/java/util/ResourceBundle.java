/**
 * A resource bundle contains locale-specific data. If you need localized
 * data, you can load a resource bundle that matches the locale with
 * <code>getBundle</code>. Now you can get your object by calling
 * <code>getObject</code> or <code>getString</code> on that bundle.
 *
 * <p>When a bundle is demanded for a specific locale, the ResourceBundle
 * is searched in following order (<i>def. language</i> stands for the
 * two letter ISO language code of the default locale (see
 * <code>Locale.getDefault()</code>).
 *
<pre>baseName_<i>language code</i>_<i>country code</i>_<i>variant</i>
baseName_<i>language code</i>_<i>country code</i>
baseName_<i>language code</i>
baseName_<i>def. language</i>_<i>def. country</i>_<i>def. variant</i>
baseName_<i>def. language</i>_<i>def. country</i>
baseName_<i>def. language</i>
baseName</pre>
 *
 * <p>A bundle is backed up by less specific bundles (omitting variant, country
 * or language). But it is not backed up by the default language locale.
 *
 * <p>If you provide a bundle for a given locale, say
 * <code>Bundle_en_UK_POSIX</code>, you must also provide a bundle for
 * all sub locales, ie. <code>Bundle_en_UK</code>, <code>Bundle_en</code>, and
 * <code>Bundle</code>.
 *
 * <p>When a bundle is searched, we look first for a class with the given
 * name, then for a file with <code>.properties</code> extension in the
 * classpath. The name must be a fully qualified classname (with dots as
 * path separators).
 *
 * <p>(Note: This implementation always backs up the class with a properties
 * file if that is existing, but you shouldn't rely on this, if you want to
 * be compatible to the standard JDK.)

   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>baseName + "_" + language1 + "_" + country1 + "_" + variant1</li>
   * <li>baseName + "_" + language1 + "_" + country1</li>

   * <li>baseName + "_" + language2 + "_" + country2</li>
   * <li>baseName + "_" + language2</li>
   * <li>baseName</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>In the sequence, entries with an empty string are ignored. Next,
   * <code>getBundle</code> tries to instantiate the resource bundle:</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>First, an attempt is made to load a class in the specified classloader
   * which is a subclass of ResourceBundle, and which has a public constructor
   * with no arguments, via reflection.</li>
   * <li>Next, a search is made for a property resource file, by replacing
   * '.' with '/' and appending ".properties", and using
   * ClassLoader.getResource(). If a file is found, then a
   * PropertyResourceBundle is created from the file's contents.</li>
   * </ul>
   * If no resource bundle was found, a MissingResourceException is thrown.
   *
   * <p>Next, the parent chain is implemented. The remaining candidate names
   * in the above sequence are tested in a similar manner, and if any results
   * in a resource bundle, it is assigned as the parent of the first bundle
   * using the <code>setParent</code> method (unless the first bundle already
   * has a parent).</p>
   *
   * <p>For example, suppose the following class and property files are
   * provided: MyResources.class, MyResources_fr_CH.properties,
   * MyResources_fr_CH.class, MyResources_fr.properties,
   * MyResources_en.properties, and MyResources_es_ES.class. The contents of
   * all files are valid (that is, public non-abstract subclasses of
   * ResourceBundle with public nullary constructors for the ".class" files,
   * syntactically correct ".properties" files). The default locale is
   * Locale("en", "UK").</p>
   *
   * <p>Calling getBundle with the shown locale argument values instantiates
   * resource bundles from the following sources:</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>Locale("fr", "CH"): result MyResources_fr_CH.class, parent
   *   MyResources_fr.properties, parent MyResources.class</li>
   * <li>Locale("fr", "FR"): result MyResources_fr.properties, parent
   *   MyResources.class</li>
   * <li>Locale("de", "DE"): result MyResources_en.properties, parent
   *   MyResources.class</li>
   * <li>Locale("en", "US"): result MyResources_en.properties, parent
   *   MyResources.class</li>
   * <li>Locale("es", "ES"): result MyResources_es_ES.class, parent
   *   MyResources.class</li>
   * </ul>
   * 
   * <p>The file MyResources_fr_CH.properties is never used because it is hidden
   * by MyResources_fr_CH.class.</p>
