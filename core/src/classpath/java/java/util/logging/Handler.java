 * <p>FIXME: Are handlers thread-safe, or is the assumption that only
 * loggers are, and a handler can belong only to one single logger? If
 * the latter, should we enforce it? (Spec not clear). In any
 * case, it needs documentation.

	 * encoding is to be used by freshly constructed Handlers.  The GNU
	 * implementation uses the default platform encoding, but other
	 * Java implementations might behave differently.
	 *
	 * <p><strong>Specification Note:</strong> While a freshly constructed
	 * Handler is required to have <em>no filter</em> according to the
	 * specification, <code>null</code> is not a valid parameter for
	 * <code>Handler.setFormatter</code>.  Therefore, the following
	 * code will throw a <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code>:
	 *
	 * <p><pre>Handler h = new MyConcreteSubclassOfHandler();
h.setFormatter(h.getFormatter());</pre>
	 *
	 * It seems strange that a freshly constructed Handler is not
	 * supposed to provide a Formatter, but this is what the specification
