/**
 * Preference node containing key value entries and subnodes.
 * <p>
 * There are two preference node trees, a system tree which can be accessed
 * by calling <code>systemRoot()</code> containing system preferences usefull
 * for all users, and a user tree that can be accessed by calling
 * <code>userRoot()</code> containing preferences that can differ between
 * different users. How different users are identified is implementation
 * depended. It can be determined by Thread, Access Control Context or Subject.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses the "java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory" system
 * property to find a class that implement <code>PreferencesFactory</code>
 * and initialized that class (if it has a public no arguments contructor)
 * to get at the actual system or user root. If the system property is not set,
 * or the class cannot be initialized it uses the default implementation
 * <code>gnu.java.util.prefs.FileBasedFactory</code>.
 * <p>
 * Besides the two static method above to get the roots of the system and user
 * preference node trees there are also two convenience methods to access the
 * default preference node for a particular package an object is in. These are
 * <code>userNodeForPackage()</code> and <code>systemNodeForPackage()</code>.
 * Both methods take an Object as an argument so accessing preferences values
 * can be as easy as calling <code>Preferences.userNodeForPackage(this)</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that if a security manager is installed all static methods check for
 * <code>RuntimePermission("preferences")</code>. But if this permission is
 * given to the code then it can access and change all (user) preference nodes
 * and entries. So you should be carefull not to store to sensitive information
 * or make security decissions based on preference values since there is no
 * more fine grained control over what preference values can be changed once
 * code has been given the correct runtime permission.
 * <p>
