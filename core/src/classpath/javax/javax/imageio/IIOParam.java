/**
 * An IIOParam stores parameters used when encoding or decoding image
 * streams.  ImageReadParam and ImageWriteParam extend this abstract
 * base class.
 *
 * IIOParams allow control over how source pixels converted into
 * destination pixels.  This conversion can take place between a
 * stream and in-memory image data, when an image reader is doing the
 * conversion, or a writer can be doing the conversion from an
 * in-memory source to a stream destination.
 *
 * An image reader can be restricted to only read from a given region;
 * likewise a writer can be restricted to only write output to a given
 * region.
 *
 * For image readers and writers, IIOParam supports image pixelation
 * -- where the input image is approximated by the output image using
 * larger-sized pixel blocks.  For example: FIXME
 *
 * IIOParams can control how pixels are combined into larger blocks
 * using sub-sampling matrices.  For example: FIXME
 *
 * They can also control which source bands are read and written; this
 * example reads the RGBA (red, green, blue, transparency) data from a
 * PNG image and outputs just the red and transparency bands: FIXME
