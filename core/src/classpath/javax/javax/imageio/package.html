<body>
<p>
This package provides image input/output APIs.
</p>
<p>
The standard class library provides other ways of loading images (@see
java.awt.Toolkit, @see java.awt.Component)) but the ImageIO package is
more powerful.
</p>
<p>
The static ImageIO class supports reading and writing images in many
different formats along with most other basic image I/O operations.
</p>
<p>
Other classes provide finer control of image-related operations;
reading is controlled by ImageReader, ImageReadParam and
ImageTypeSpecifyer, writing by ImageWriter and ImageWriteParam.
ImageTranscoder allows fine-grained control over how images are
converted between formats and IIOException reports errors.  IIOImage
describes an image file in detail including metadata and thumbnails.
</p>
<h2>Supported Formats</h2>
<p>
The default GNU Classpath ImageIO backend uses ImageMagick and so
supports the following formats:
<table>
<tr>
<th></th> <th>Read</th> <th>Write</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>JPEG</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>PNG</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>BMP</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>WBMP</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>GIF</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>TIFF</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>XPM</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>TGA</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>PDF</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>SVG</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
