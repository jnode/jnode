/**
 * <p>
 * Describes the interface of a management bean.  This allows
 * the user to access the bean dynamically, without knowing
 * the details of any of its attributes, operations,
 * constructors or notifications beforehand.  The information
 * is immutable as standard.  Of course, subclasses may change
 * this, but this behaviour is not recommended.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The contents of this class, for standard management beans,
 * are dynamically compiled using reflection.
 * {@link #getClassName()} and {@link #getConstructors()}
 * return the name of the class and its constructors, respectively.
 * This is much the same as could be obtained by reflection on the
 * bean.  {@link #getAttributes()} and {@link #getOperations()},
 * however, do something more in splitting the methods of the
 * class into two sets.  Those of the form, <code>getXXX</code>,
 * <code>setXXX</code> and <code>isXXX</code> are taken to be
 * the accessors and mutators of a series of attributes, with
 * <code>XXX</code> being the attribute name.  These are returned
 * by {@link getAttributes()} and the {@link Attribute} class can
 * be used to manipulate them.  The remaining methods are classified
 * as operations and returned by {@link getOperations()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Beans can also broadcast notifications.  If the bean provides this
 * facility, by implementing the {@link NotificationBroadcaster}
 * interface, then an array of {@link MBeanNotificationInfo} objects
 * may be obtained from {@link #getNotifications()}, which describe
 * the notifications emitted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Model management beans and open management beans also supply an
 * instance of this class, as part of implementing the
 * {@link DynamicMBean#getMBeanInfo()} method of {@link DynamicMBean}.
 * </p>
