<body>

<p>
Provides the data types and descriptor classes for the
<emph>Open MBean</emph>s.  Open MBeans are provided in
order to aid interoperability with non-Java management
systems.  Unlike normal MBeans, which make use of any
Java data type, Open MBeans use a restricted set of types
which can then be mapped over remote connections, including
to non-Java systems.
</p>
<p>
Normal MBeans are described using an instance of
{@link javax.management.MBeanInfo} with appropriate representations
of the attributes, constructors and operators associated with
the bean.  Open MBeans are described in the same way, but by
using subtypes of these entities, which type the bean data using
instances of {@link javax.management.openmbean.OpenType}.  Open
types differ from Java types, and are explicitly specified in order
to obtain interoperability with other systems.
