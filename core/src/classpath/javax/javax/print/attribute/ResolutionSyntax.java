/**
 * <code>ResolutionSyntax</code> is the abstract base class of all attribute 
 * classes which provide a resolution as value (e.g. printer resolution).
 * <p>
 * A <code>ResolutionSyntax</code> instance consists of two integer values
 * describing the resolution in feed and cross feed direction. The units of 
 * the given values is determined by two defined constants:
 * <ul>
 * <li>DPCM - dots per centimeter</li>
 * <li>DPI - dots per inch</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A resolutions attribute is constructed by two values for the resolution and
 * one of the two constants defining the actual units of the given values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are different methods provided to return the resolution values in 
 * either of the both units and to compare if a resolution is less than or
 * equal to a given other resolution attribute.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Internal storage:</b><br>
 * The resolutions are stored internally as dots per 100 inches (dphi). The 
 * values of the provided constants for dots per inch (value 100) and dots
 * per centimeter (value 254) are used as conversion factors to the internal
 * storage units. To get the internal dphi values a multiplication of a given
 * resolution value with its units constant value is needed. Retrieving the 
 * resolution for specific units is done by dividing the internal stored 
 * value through the units constant value. Clients are therefore able to 
 * provide their own resolution units by supplying other conversion factors.
 * Subclasses of <code>ResolutionSyntax</code> have access to the internal
 * resolution values through the protected methods 
 * {@link #getCrossFeedResolutionDphi()} and {@link #getFeedResolutionDphi()}.
 * </p>
