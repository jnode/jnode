/**
 * <code>Size2DSyntax</code> is the abstract base class of all attribute 
 * classes which provide a two dimensional size as value (e.g. the size of
 * a media like Letter or A4).
 * <p>
 * A <code>Size2DSyntax</code> instance consists of two integer values
 * describing the size in the x and y dimension. The units of 
 * the given values is determined by two defined constants:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INCH - defines an inch</li>
 * <li>MM - defines a millimeter</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A size 2D attribute is constructed by two values for the size of the x and
 * y dimension and the actual units of the given values as defined by the 
 * constants.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are different methods provided to return the size values for the
 * dimensions in either of the two predefined units or with a given client
 * supplied units conversion factor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Internal storage:</b><br>
 * The size of the x,y dimensions are stored internally in micrometers. The 
 * values of the provided constants for inch (value 25400) and millimeters
 * (value 1000) are used as conversion factors to the internal storage units.
 * To get the internal micrometers values a multiplication of a given
 * size value with its units constant value is done. Retrieving the size value
 * for specific units is done by dividing the internal stored value by the 
 * units constant value. Clients are therefore able to provide their own 
 * size units by supplying other conversion factors.
 * Subclasses of <code>Size2DSyntax</code> have access to the internal
 * size values through the protected methods 
 * {@link #getXMicrometers()} and {@link #getYMicrometers()}.
 * </p>
