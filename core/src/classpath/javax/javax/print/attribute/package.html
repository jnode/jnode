<body>
<p>Provides classes and interfaces describing the roles and 
syntax of attribute objects in the Java Print Service API.</p>
<p>
The package contains the base attribute interface and several subinterfaces 
describing the different attribute roles of printing attributes. Furthermore,
abstract classes defining the syntax of attributes are provided. For 
collections of attributes based on their roles different set interfaces and
implementing classes are available.
</p><p>
Existing attribute roles are:
<ul>
<li><a href="PrintServiceAttribute.html">PrintServiceAttribute</a>s  
describing the state and other informations of a PrintService.</li>
<li><a href="PrintJobAttribute.html">PrintJobAttribute</a>s describing
the state of the print job.</li>
<li><a href="PrintRequestAttribute.html">PrintRequestAttribute</a>s specifying 
how a print job should be printed and are applied to a complete print job.</li>
<li><a href="PrintJobAttribute.html">PrintJobAttribute</a> s specifying 
how a single document in the print job should be printed.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Every attribute is of a certain syntax which defines its type and the 
representation of its value. The different syntax types are provided as 
abstract syntax classes (e.g. <code>IntegerSyntax</code>). Concrete attribute 
implementations are subclasses of these abstract syntax classes.
</p><p>
Attributes may be collected as sets of attributes. Different interfaces for
attribute collections per role and implementations based on a HashMap are 
provided (for example <a href="HashPrintJobAttributeSet.html">
HashPrintJobAttributeSet</a> for the print job attributes).
