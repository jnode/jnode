/**
 * The <code>Chromaticity</code> printing attribute specifies if print data
 * should be printed in monochrome or color.
 * <p>
 * The attribute interacts with the document to be printed. If the document
 * to be printed is a monochrome document it will be printed monochrome 
 * regardless of the value of this attribute category. However if it is a
 * color document supplying the attribute value <code>MONOCHROME</code>
 * will prepare the document to be printed in monochrome instead of color.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This printing attribute has nothing to do with the capabilities of the
 * printer device. To check if a specific printer service supports printing
 * in color you have to use the attribute
 * {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.ColorSupported}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> Chromaticity is not an IPP 1.1 attribute.
