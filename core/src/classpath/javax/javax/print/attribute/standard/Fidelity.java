/**
 * The <code>Fidelity</code> attribute specifies how a print job is handled
 * if the supplied attributes are not fully supported.
 * <p>
 * There may be conflicts between the client requested attributes and the
 * attributes supported by the printer object. Such situations are controlled
 * through the client by providing this attribute to indicate the wanted
 * conflict handling mechanism:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #FIDELITY_TRUE}: Reject the job since the job can not be 
 * processed exactly as specified by the attributes of the client.</li>
 * <li>{@link #FIDELITY_FALSE}: The Printer may make any changes necessary 
 * to proceed with processing the Job as good as possible.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> Fidelity is an IPP 1.1 attribute. The IPP name
 * is "ipp-attribute-fidelity". The IPP specification treats Fidelity as a 
 * boolean type which is not available in the Java Print Service API. The IPP
 * boolean value "true" corresponds to <code>FIDELITY_TRUE</code> and "false" 
 * to <code>FIDELITY_FALSE</code>.
