/**
 * The <code>Finishings</code> attribute specifies the finishing operations
 * that the Printer applies to every copy of each printed document in the Job.
 * <p>
 * Standard enum values are: <code>NONE</code>, <code>STAPLE</code>, 
 * <code>COVER</code>, <code>BIND</code>, <code>SADDLE_STITCH</code>,
 * <code>EDGE_STITCH</code>.
 * <br><br>
 * The following values are more specific: 
 * <code>STAPLE_TOP_LEFT</code>, <code>STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT</code>, 
 * <code>STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT</code>, <code>STAPLE_BOTTOM_RIGHT</code>, 
 * <code>EDGE_STITCH_LEFT</code>, <code>EDGE_STITCH_TOP</code>, 
 * <code>EDGE_STITCH_RIGHT</code>, <code>EDGE_STITCH_BOTTOM</code>, 
 * <code>STAPLE_DUAL_LEFT</code>, <code>STAPLE_DUAL_TOP</code>, 
 * <code>STAPLE_DUAL_RIGHT</code>, <code>STAPLE_DUAL_BOTTOM</code>.
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> The effect of this attribute on jobs with multiple documents 
 * is controlled by the job attribute 
 * {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.MultipleDocumentHandling}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> Finishings is an IPP 1.1 attribute. Differences 
 * to the IPP specification are that in the Java Print Service API only one 
 * enum value is supported (in IPP a set of enums). Further the enum 
 * <code>punch</code> is not supported.
