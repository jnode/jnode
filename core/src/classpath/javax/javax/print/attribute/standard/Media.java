/**
 * The <code>Media</code> printing attribute specifies which
 * type of media should be used for printing.
 * <p>
 * The media to be used can be specified in three ways represented
 * by the media subclasses {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.MediaTray},
 * {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.MediaName} and 
 * {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.MediaSizeName}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Selection by paper source - selection of printer tray to be used.</li>
 * <li>Selection by name - e.g. A4 paper.</li>
 * <li>Selection by standard sizes - e.g. ISO A5, JIS B4.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each of the sublcasses represents the IPP attribute <code>media</code>
 * and provides predefined values to be used.
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> Media is an IPP 1.1 attribute.
