 * class implements methods, required for remote or local invocation using CORBA
 * mechanisms. The most of the functionality is forwarded to the stub delegate.
 * This delegate can be altered by setting the system property
 * "javax.rmi.CORBA.StubClass" to the name of the alternative class that must
 * implement {@link StubDelegate}. Hence Stub contains two delegates, one for
 * Stub-related operations and another inherited from the ObjectImpl.
 * 
 * @specnote GNU Classpath uses separate delegate per each Stub. The delegate
 * holds information about the ORB and other data, specific for the each Stub.
