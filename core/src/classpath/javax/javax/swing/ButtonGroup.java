/**
 * Logically groups a set of buttons, so that only one of the buttons in
 * a <code>ButtonGroup</code> can be selected at the same time. If one
 * button in a <code>ButtonGroup</code> is selected, all other buttons
 * are automatically deselected.
 *
 * While <code>ButtonGroup</code> can be used for all buttons that are derived
 * from {@link AbstractButton}, it is normally only used for
 * {@link JRadioButton}s, {@link JRadioButtonMenuItem}s and
 * {@link JToggleButton}s.
 *
 * You could use it for {@link JCheckBox}es, but for the sake of usability
 * this is strongly discouraged because the common expectation of checkboxes
 * is that the user is allowed to make multiple selections.
 *
 * It makes no sense to put {@link JButton}s or {@link JMenuItem}s in
 * a <code>ButtonGroup</code> because they don't implement the
 * <code>selected</code> semantics.
