/**
 * The <code>JRadioButton</code> component provides a visually selectable
 * button with mutually exclusive behaviour within a <code>ButtonGroup</code>.
 * A series of radio buttons can be used to provide options to the user,
 * where the user can only select one of the available options.  The state
 * of the button is provided by the superclass, <code>JToggleButton</code>.
 * <code>JRadioButton</code> adds the additional behaviour, that if two
 * or more radio buttons are grouped together, the selection of one implies
 * the deselection of the other buttons within the group.
 * <p>
 *
 * Buttons are grouped by adding each instance to a <code>ButtonGroup</code>.
 * The existence of such a grouping is not reflected visually, so other means
 * should be used to denote this.  For instance, the grouped buttons can be placed
 * within the same panel, possibly with an appropriate border to denote
 * the connection between the components.
