 * This implementation of {@link AbstractDocument.Content} uses a gapped
 * buffer. This takes advantage of the fact that text area content is
 * mostly inserted sequentially. The buffer is a char array that maintains
 * a gap at the current insertion point. If characters a inserted at
 * gap boundaries, the cost is minimal (simple array access). The array only
 * has to be shifted around when the insertion point moves (then the gap also
 * moves and one array copy is necessary) or when the gap is filled up and
 * the buffer has to be enlarged.
