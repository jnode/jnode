/**
 * A view for HTML <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tags.
 *
 * This is a {@link ComponentView} that creates special components depending
 * on the object specification. If the object tag has a classid attribute, then
 * this view will try to load the class specified by this attribute using the
 * classloader that loaded the associated document. If the class could be
 * loaded, an instance is created and the type narrowed to {@link Component}.
 *
 * It is also possible to set bean properties on the created component using
 * nested <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> tags. For example:
 * <pre>
 * <object classid="javax.swing.JLabel">
 *   <param name="text" value="sample text">
 * </object>
 * </pre>
