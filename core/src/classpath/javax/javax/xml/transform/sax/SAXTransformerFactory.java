/**
 * A TransformerFactory that supports several separate modes for
 * working with SAX inputs and outputs.  Those modes include: <ul>
 *
 * <li> Pipeline Stage, pushing events through {@link TransformerHandler}
 *	objects used as SAX handlers, and passing the transformed data
 *	through a {@link SAXResult} encapsulating SAX ContentHandler and
 *	LexicalHandler objects;
 * <li> Pipeline Termination, like a normal pipeline stage but using some
 *	other kind of {@link Result} to store transformed data rather than
 *	passing it to another stage;
 * <li> Event producer, an {@link XMLFilter} object taking data from a URI
 *	or from a SAX {@link InputSource} input object and delivering it
 *	to a SAX ContentHandler;
 * <li>	Transformer objects produced by this factory will usually be able
 *	to accept {@link SAXSource} objects as inputs, and the XMLReader
 *	object in such a source could be an XMLFilter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Transformer objects produced by this factory will of course be
 * able to perform {@link Transformer#transform Transformer.transform()}
 * operations to map XML text into other text.
 *
 * <p>The factory also supports creating Templates objects.
