Provides an ASM visitor that constructs a tree representation of the
classes it visits. This class adapter can be useful to implement "complex"
class manipulation operations, i.e., operations that would be very hard to
implement without using a tree representation (such as optimizing the number
of local variables used by a method).
</p>
  
<p>
However, this class adapter has a cost: it makes ASM bigger and slower. Indeed
it requires more than twenty new classes, and multiplies the time needed to
transform a class by almost two (it is almost two times faster to read, "modify"
and write a class with a ClassAdapter than with a ClassNode). This is why
this package is bundled in an optional <tt>asm-tree.jar</tt> library that
is separated from (but requires) the <tt>asm.jar</tt> library, which contains
the core ASM framework. This is also why <i><font color="red">it is recommanded
not to use this class adapter when it is possible</font></i>.
</p>

<p>
The root class is the ClassNode, that can be created from scratch or
from existing bytecode. For example:
</p>
  
<pre>
  ClassReader cr = new ClassReader(source);
  ClassNode cn = new ClassNode();
  cr.accept(cn, true);
</pre>

<p>  
Now content of ClassNode can be modified and then
serialized back into bytecode:
</p>

<pre>
  ClassWriter cw = new ClassWriter(true);
  cn.accept(cw);
</pre>  

<p>
Several strategies can be used to construct method code from scratch. The first
possibility is to create a MethodNode, and then create and add XXXInsnNode to 
the instructions list:
</p>

<pre>
MethodNode m = new MethodNode(...);
m.instructions.add(new VarInsnNode(ALOAD, 0));
...
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you can use the fact that MethodNode is a MethodVisitor, and use
that to create the XXXInsnNode and add them to the instructions list through
the standard MethodVisitor interface:
</p>

<pre>
MethodNode m = new MethodNode(...);
m.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 0);
...
</pre>

<p>
If you cannot generate all the instructions in sequential order, i.e. if you 
need to keep some pointers in the instruction list to insert some instructions
at these places after other instructions have been generated, you can define
an InsnListInsnNode pseudo instruction class that will in fact contain an 
instruction list, will possibly implement the MethodVisitor interface, and whose
accept method will call the accept method of all the instructions of its list.
</p>

<pre>
MethodNode m = new MethodNode(...);
m.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 0);
InsnListInsnNode ptr = new InsnListInsnNode();
m.instructions.add(ptr);
m.visitVarInsn(ALOAD, 1);
ptr.visitXXXInsn(...); // inserts an instruction between ALOAD 0 and ALOAD 1
</pre>

<p>
If you need to insert instructions while iterating over an existing instruction 
list, you can also use several strategies. The first one is to use a 
ListIterator over the instruction list, and use its add method to insert
instructions:
</p>

<pre>
ListIterator i = m.instructions.listIterator();
while (i.hasNext()) {
    AbstractInsnNode n = (AbstractInsnNode) i.next();
    if (...) {
        i.add(new VarInsnNode(ALOAD, 0));
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
If you want to insert these instructions through the MethodVisitor interface,
you can define your own InsnListIterator class, that will implement both the 
ListIterator and MethodVisitor interface.
</p>

<p>
Another strategy is to use ListIterator.add to insert InsnListInsnNode pseudo
instructions, and then use these inserted pseudo instructions to insert an 
arbitrary number of instructions at these places.
