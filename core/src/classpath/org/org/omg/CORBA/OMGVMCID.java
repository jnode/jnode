 * The higher 20 bits of any CORBA exception hold "Vendor Minor Codeset ID"
 * (VMCID), for instance 0x4F4D0000 (OMG standard), 0x54410000 (TAO), 0x4A430000
 * (JacORB), 0x49540000 (IONA), 0x53550000 (Sun).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * GNU Classpath official vendor minor code set id is 0x47430000 ("GC\x00\x00"),
 * and the reserved space spans till 0x47430FFF, allowing to use up to 4096
 * Classpath specific exceptions. It was assigned 30/09/2005 by OMG Vice President
 * Andrew Watson.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The standard minor codes for the standard system exceptions are prefaced by
 * the VMCID assigned to OMG, defined as 0x4F4D0000 (the code of the minor field
 * for the standard exception with minor code 1 is 0x4F4D0001). Within a vendor
 * assigned space, the assignment of values to minor codes is left to the
 * vendor.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The VMCID 0 and 0xFFFFF0000 are reserved for experimental use.
