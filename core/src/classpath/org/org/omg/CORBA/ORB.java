/**
 * A central class in CORBA implementation, responsible for sending and
 * handling remote invocations. ORB also works as a factory for
 * creating instances of certain CORBA classes.
 *
 * Despite the core library contains the fully working CORBA implementation,
 * it also provides a simple way to plug-in the alternative CORBA support.
 * This is done by replacing the ORB. The alternative ORB can be specified
 * via properties, passed to ORB.Init(...).
 *
 * When creating an ORB instance, the class name
 * is searched in the following locations:
 * <p>
 * 1. Applet parameter or application string array, if any.<br>
 * 2. The properties parameter, if any.<br>
 * 3. The System properties.<br>
 * 4. The orb.properties file located in the user.home directory (if any).<br>
 * 5. The orb.properties file located in the java.home/lib directory (if any).
 * </p>
 *
 * The supported properties are:
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr><td> org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass</td><td>The class,
 *   implementing the functional ORB, returned by
 *   {@link #init(Applet, Properties)} or
 *   {@link #init(String[], Properties)} </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass</td><td>The class,
 *   implementing the restricted ORB, returned by
 *   {@link #init()}.
 * </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitRef</td><td>Specifies the
 * initial reference, accessible by name with the method
 * {@link #resolve_initial_references(String)}.
 * </table>
 * The command line accepts the same properties as a keys. When specifying
 * in the command line, the prefix org.omg.CORBA can be omitted,
 * for instance<code> -ORBInitRef NameService=IOR:aabbccdd....</code>
