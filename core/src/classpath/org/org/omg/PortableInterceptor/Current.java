/**
 * <p>
 * The portable interceptor Current (PICurrent) contains multiple slots where an
 * interceptor can rememeber the request - specific values between subsequent
 * calls of the interceptor methods. In multithreaded environment, it is not
 * possible just to store such data in the interceptor object fields.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * On the client side, it is possible to set the initial slot values by
 * modifying slots on the Current, returend by ORB.resolve_initial_references
 * ("PICurrent"). The returned value is narrowed with the
 * {@link CurrentHelper#narrow}. On the subsequent invocation, made from the
 * same thread, the interceptors will see the initial slot values as they were
 * set using this approach.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are no way to set the initial values for the server side interceptors,
 * the default values (Any with typecode TCKind.tk_null) should be always
 * assumed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since an Interceptor is running in a thread, it is running with a thread
 * context and there is a PICurrent on that context. If the Interceptor calls
 * ORB.resolve_initial_references ("PICurrent"), it gets the PICurrent within
 * its thread scope. This PICurrent is different than the request scope
 * PICurrent that the Interceptor obtains via calls to the Client- or Server-
 * RequestInfo object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * On the client side the PICurrent can be used to detect the recursive
 * invocations, performed by interceptors. If one of the interceptors makes call
 * via the same ORB, this call is then showed to all interceptors, including the
 * interceptor that made it. To avoid infinite recursion, the during each call
 * this interceptor can set some "recursion flag" into one of the slots of the
 * PICurrent. If the flag is set on the entry point, this indicates a recursive
 * call of that request.
 * </p>
