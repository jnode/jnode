<body>
Interceptors are hooks than can monitor various stages of the CORBA request 
processing. The {@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.IORInterceptor} monitors
all new object refereces (IORs) being created and can add to them additional
information. The {@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ClientRequestInterceptor}
monitors request handling on the client side and the 
{@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ServerRequestInterceptor} monitors request
handling on the server side. The client and server request interceptors can
add additional data to the CORBA message that is accessible on remote side
after the message is transmitted. They can also forward request to another
target. All interceptor functions also work for the local invocations. The
interceptors are registered in ORB.init(...) using 
{@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializer}.
