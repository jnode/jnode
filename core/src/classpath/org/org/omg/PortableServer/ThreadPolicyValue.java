/**
 * Defines the possible values for the POA thread policy.
 *
 * This enumeration can obtain the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ORB_CTRL_MODEL Each object in POA has a separate serving thread
 * and a separate server socket, listening on the objects individual
 * port. Additionally, when the request is accepted, it is also
 * served in a separate thread, so several requests to the same
 * object can be processed in parallel. The servant can always get
 * the Id and POA of the object it is currently serving by
 * invoking {@link Servant#_object_id()} and {@link Servant#_poa}.
 * These two methods use thread to data map and must work correctly
 * even then the servant code is executed in several parallel threads.
 * </li>
 * <li>SINGLE_THREAD_MODEL All objects in POA share the same server
 * socket and are served in the same thread. This model is applicable
 * when the number of objects is greater than the number of threads
 * and (or) ports, supported by the system.</li>
 * </ul>
 * OMG also defines a MAIN_THREAD_MODEL, currently not supported by
 * the java API.
