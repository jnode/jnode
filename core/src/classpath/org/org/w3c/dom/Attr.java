/**
 * The <code>Attr</code> interface represents an attribute in an 
 * <code>Element</code> object. Typically the allowable values for the 
 * attribute are defined in a document type definition.
 * <p><code>Attr</code> objects inherit the <code>Node</code> interface, but 
 * since they are not actually child nodes of the element they describe, the 
 * DOM does not consider them part of the document tree. Thus, the 
 * <code>Node</code> attributes <code>parentNode</code>, 
 * <code>previousSibling</code>, and <code>nextSibling</code> have a 
 * <code>null</code> value for <code>Attr</code> objects. The DOM takes the 
 * view that attributes are properties of elements rather than having a 
 * separate identity from the elements they are associated with; this should 
 * make it more efficient to implement such features as default attributes 
 * associated with all elements of a given type. Furthermore, 
 * <code>Attr</code> nodes may not be immediate children of a 
 * <code>DocumentFragment</code>. However, they can be associated with 
 * <code>Element</code> nodes contained within a 
 * <code>DocumentFragment</code>. In short, users and implementors of the 
 * DOM need to be aware that <code>Attr</code> nodes have some things in 
 * common with other objects inheriting the <code>Node</code> interface, but 
 * they also are quite distinct.
 * <p>The attribute's effective value is determined as follows: if this 
 * attribute has been explicitly assigned any value, that value is the 
 * attribute's effective value; otherwise, if there is a declaration for 
 * this attribute, and that declaration includes a default value, then that 
 * default value is the attribute's effective value; otherwise, the 
 * attribute does not exist on this element in the structure model until it 
 * has been explicitly added. Note that the <code>nodeValue</code> attribute 
 * on the <code>Attr</code> instance can also be used to retrieve the string 
 * version of the attribute's value(s).
 * <p>In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain entity references, 
 * the child nodes of the <code>Attr</code> node may be either 
 * <code>Text</code> or <code>EntityReference</code> nodes (when these are 
 * in use; see the description of <code>EntityReference</code> for 
 * discussion). Because the DOM Core is not aware of attribute types, it 
 * treats all attribute values as simple strings, even if the DTD or schema 
 * declares them as having tokenized types.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification</a>.

     * attribute, not the user. If the user changes the value of the 
     * attribute (even if it ends up having the same value as the default 
     * value) then the <code>specified</code> flag is automatically flipped 
     * to <code>true</code>. To re-specify the attribute as the default 
     * value from the DTD, the user must delete the attribute. The 
     * implementation will then make a new attribute available with 
     * <code>specified</code> set to <code>false</code> and the default

     * <br>In summary: If the attribute has an assigned value in the document

     * the document and has a value of #IMPLIED in the DTD, then the 
     * attribute does not appear in the structure model of the document.If 
     * the <code>ownerElement</code> attribute is <code>null</code> (i.e. 
     * because it was just created or was set to <code>null</code> by the 
     * various removal and cloning operations) <code>specified</code> is
