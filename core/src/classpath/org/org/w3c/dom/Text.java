/**
 * The <code>Text</code> interface inherits from <code>CharacterData</code> 
 * and represents the textual content (termed character data in XML) of an 
 * <code>Element</code> or <code>Attr</code>. If there is no markup inside 
 * an element's content, the text is contained in a single object 
 * implementing the <code>Text</code> interface that is the only child of 
 * the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into the information items 
 * (elements, comments, etc.) and <code>Text</code> nodes that form the list 
 * of children of the element.
 * <p>When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one 
 * <code>Text</code> node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent 
 * <code>Text</code> nodes that represent the contents of a given element 
 * without any intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way 
 * to represent the separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they 
 * will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The 
 * <code>normalize()</code> method on <code>Node</code> merges any such 
 * adjacent <code>Text</code> objects into a single node for each block of 
 * text.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification</a>.
