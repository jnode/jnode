/**
 * VM-specific methods for generating real (or almost real) random
 * seeds. VM implementors should write a version of this class that
 * reads random bytes from some system source.
 *
 * <p>The default implementation of this class runs eight threads that
 * increment counters in a tight loop, and XORs each counter to
 * produce one byte of seed data. This is not very efficient, and is
 * not guaranteed to be random (the thread scheduler is probably
 * deterministic, after all). If possible, VM implementors should
 * reimplement this class so it obtains a random seed from a system
 * facility, such as a system entropy gathering device or hardware
 * random number generator.
