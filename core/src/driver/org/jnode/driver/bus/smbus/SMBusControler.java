/**
 * SMBus controller.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Title: SMBus
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Description:
 * </p>
 * The System Management Bus (SMBus) is a two-wire interface through which various system component
 * chips can communicate with each other and with the rest of the system. It is based on the
 * principles of . SMBus provides a control bus for system and power management related tasks. A
 * system may use SMBus to pass messages to and from devices instead of tripping individual control
 * lines. Removing the individual control lines reduces pin count. Accepting messages ensures
 * future expandability. With System Management Bus, a device can provide manufacturer information,
 * tell the system what its model/part number is, save its state for a suspend event, report
 * different types of errors, accept control parameters, and return its status.
 * <P>
 * The System Management Bus Specification refers to three types of devices. A slave is a device
 * that is receiving or responding to a command. A master is a device that issues commands,
 * generates the clocks, and terminates the transfer. A host is a specialized master that provides
 * the main interface to the system's CPU. A host must be a master-slave and must support the SMBus
 * host notify protocol. There may be at most one host in a system. One example of a hostless
 * system is a simple battery charging station. The station might sit plugged into a wall waiting
 * to charge a smart battery. A device may be designed so that it is never a master and always a
 * slave. A device may act as a slave most of the time, but in special instances it may become a
 * master. A device can also be designed to be a master only. A system host is an example of a
 * device that acts as a host most of the time but that includes some slave behavior..
 * <P>
 * Any device that exists on the System Management Bus as a slave has a unique address called the
 * Slave Address. For reference, the following addresses are reserved and must not be used by or
 * assigned to any SMBus slave device unless otherwise detailed by this specification.
