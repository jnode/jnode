/**
 * KeyInputStream maps keyboard events into a stream of characters.  Current functionality includes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>line buffering and line editing, using a text console,
 * <li>integrated input history and completion,
 * <li>CTRL-D is interpretted as a 'soft' EOF mark,KeyboardInputStream
 * <li>listens to keyboard focus events.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Future enhancements include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a "raw" mode in which characters and other keyboard events are delivered without line editing,
 * <li>a "no echo" mode in which line editting occurs without echoing of input characters,
 * <li>making the active characters and keycodes "soft",
 * <li>making completion and history context sensitive; e.g. when switching between a shell and 
 * an application, and
 * <li>code refactoring to support classical terminal devices and remote consoles.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Bugs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The current method of echoing the input is suboptimal, and is broken in the case where an 
 * application outputs a prompt string to stdout or stderr.
 * </ul>
