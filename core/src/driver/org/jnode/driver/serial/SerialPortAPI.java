     * Configure the data format to be sent. Data is sent in blocks of 5 to 8
     * bits, with 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits and optional parity bits, in a
     * definable baud rate.
     * <p/>
     * The baud rate cannot be set directly, but only by a divisor parameter.
     * The actual rate is then determined by the formula (115200/divisor). This
     * is to allow most accurate control over the serial port hardware, which
     * allows control only through a divisor value. The driver interface
     * defines some constants for often-used baud rates.
     * <p/>
     * This driver always maps one byte from the driver's data channel to one
     * data block on the serial port. When reading or writing data in blocks
     * less than 8 bits, the most significant bits are ignored (sending) or
     * cleared (receiving).
     * <p/>
     * The number of stop bits is determined as follows: If the longStop
     * parameter is false, then one stop bit is used. Otherwise, a longer stop
     * sequence is used: If the data block length is 5 bits, then 1.5 stop bits
     * are used. If the data block length is 6-8 bits, then 2 stop bits are
     * used.
     * <p/>
     * Note that configuration of the serial port first requires to flush all
     * buffers. If there is more data to be sent or received, this method
     * blocks until that has happened.
     *
     * @param divisor  defines the baud rate divisor
     * @param bits     defines the number of bits per data block, ranging 5-8.
     * @param longStop determines whether more than one stop bit is used
     * @param parity   enables the parity bit
     * @param pEven    determines whether even parity (true) or odd parity (false)
     *                 is sent
