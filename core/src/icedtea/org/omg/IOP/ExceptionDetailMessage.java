       * ExceptionDetailMessage identifies a CDR encapsulation of a wstring,
       * encoded using GIOP 1.2 with a TCS-W of UTF-16.  This service context
       * may be sent on Reply messages with a reply_status of SYSTEM_EXCEPTION
       * or USER_EXCEPTION. The usage of this service context is defined
       * by language mappings. <br/> <br/>
       *
       * IDL/Java: ptc/02-01-22: 1.15.2: 
       * When a System Exception is marshaled, its GIOP Reply message shall
       * include an associated ExceptionDetailMessage service context. The
       * callee's stack trace is often very valuable debugging information but
       * may contain sensitive or unwanted information. The wstring within the
       * service context will therefore contain additional information relating
       * to the exception, for example the result of calling either
       * printStackTrace(PrintWriter) or getMessage() on the exception. When
       * unmarshaling a System Exception on the client side, the wstring from
       * any ExceptionDetailMessage service context shall become the Java error
       * message in the unmarshaled exception object.
