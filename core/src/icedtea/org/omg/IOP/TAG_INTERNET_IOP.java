       * Identifies profiles that 
       * support the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol. The <code>ProfileBody</code>
       * of this profile contains a CDR encapsulation of a structure 
       * containing addressing and object identification information used by 
       * IIOP. Version 1.1 of the <code>TAG_INTERNET_IOP</code> profile 
       * also includes an array of TaggedComponent objects that can 
       * contain additional information supporting optional IIOP features, 
       * ORB services such as security, and future protocol extensions. 
       * <p>
       * Protocols other than IIOP (such as ESIOPs and other GIOPs) can share 
       * profile information (such as object identity or security 
       * information) with IIOP by encoding their additional profile information 
       * as components in the <code>TAG_INTERNET_IOP</code> profile. All 
       * <code>TAG_INTERNET_IOP</code> profiles support IIOP, regardless of 
       * whether they also support additional protocols. Interoperable 
       * ORBs are not required to create or understand any other profile, 
       * nor are they required to create or understand any of the components 
       * defined for other protocols that might share the 
       * <code>TAG_INTERNET_IOP</code> profile with IIOP. 
       * <p>
       * The <code>profile_data</code> for the <code>TAG_INTERNET_IOP</code> 
       * profile is a CDR encapsulation of the <code>IIOP.ProfileBody_1_1</code>
       * type.
