       * It is often useful in the real world to be able to identify the 
       * particular kind of ORB an object reference is coming from, to work 
       * around problems with that particular ORB, or exploit shared 
       * efficiencies. 
       * <p>
       * The <code>TAG_ORB_TYPE</code> component has an associated value of 
       * type unsigned long (Java long), encoded as a CDR encapsulation, 
       * designating an ORB type ID allocated by the OMG for the ORB type of the 
       * originating ORB. Anyone may register any ORB types by submitting 
       * a short (one-paragraph) description of the ORB type to the OMG, 
       * and will receive a new ORB type ID in return. A list of ORB type 
       * descriptions and values will be made available on the OMG web server. 
       * <p>
       * The <code>TAG_ORB_TYPE</code> component can appear at most once in 
       * any IOR profile. For profiles supporting IIOP 1.1 or greater, it 
       * is optionally present.
