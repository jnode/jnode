/**
 * This file is a <b>stub</b> file representing all VM-specific constants. This
 * file will be shadowed by a <i>concrete</i> instance of itself supplied by
 * the client VM, populated with VM-specific values. <i>The specific values in
 * this stub file are therefore meaningless.</i>
 * <p>
 * Note that these methods look as though they are constants. This is
 * intentional. They would be constants except that we want MMTk to be
 * Java->bytecode compiled separately, ahead of time, in a VM-neutral way. MMTk
 * must be compiled against this stub, but if these were actual constants rather
 * than methods, then the Java compiler would legally constant propagate and
 * constant fold the values in this file, thereby ignoring the real values held
 * in the concrete VM-specific file. The constants are realized correctly at
 * class initialization time, so the performance overhead of this approach is
 * negligible (and has been measured to be insignificant). $Id:
