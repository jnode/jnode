This package provides methods to read files from a JAR file and
to transform them to a more compact transfer format called Pack200.
It also provides methods to receive the transmitted data and expand
it into a JAR file equivalent to the original JAR file.

<p> 
The <tt>pack</tt> methods may be used by application developers
who wish to deploy large JARs on the web.  The <tt>unpack</tt> methods may be used 
by deployment applications such as Java Web Start and Java Plugin.

<p>
In typical use, the packed output should be further compressed using
a suitable tool such as gzip or <tt>java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream</tt>.
The resulting file (with a suffix ".pack.gz") should be hosted on a HTTP/1.1
compliant server, which will be capable of handling "Accept-Encoding",
as specified by the HTTP 1.1 RFC2616 specification.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> It is recommended that the original ".jar" file be hosted
in addition to the ".pack.gz" file, so that older client implementations
will continue to work reliably.
(On-demand compression by the server is not recommended.)

<p>
When a client application requests a ".jar" file (call it "Large.jar"),
the client will transmit the  headers
"Content-Type=application/x-java-archive" as well as "Accept-Encoding=pack200-gzip".
This indicates to the server that the client application desires an version
of the file encoded with Pack200 and further compressed with gzip.

<p>
The server implementation will typically check for the existence of "Large.pack.gz".
If that file is available, the server will transmit it with the headers
"Content-Encoding=pack200-gzip" and "Content-Type=application/x-java-archive". 

<p>
If the ".pack.gz" file, is not available, then the server will transmit
the original ".jar"
with "Content-Encoding=null" and "Content-Type=application/x-java-archive".

<p>
A MIME type of "application/x-java-pack200" may be specified by the
client application to indicate a ".pack" file is required.
However, this has limited capability, and is not recommended.
