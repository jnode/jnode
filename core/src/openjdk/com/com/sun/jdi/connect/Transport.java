/**
 * A method of communication between a debugger and a target VM.

 * connection with a target VM. It consists of a name which is obtained 
 * by invoking the {@link #name} method. Furthermore, a Transport
 * encapsulates a {@link com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService
 * TransportService} which is the underlying service used
 * to establish connections and exchange Java Debug Wire Protocol
 * (JDWP) packets with a target VM.
