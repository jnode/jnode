This package is used to request that a JDI
event be sent under specified conditions.
With the exception of termination events, which are
always sent, there is one kind of 
{@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest} for each kind of 
{@link com.sun.jdi.event.Event Event} - for example,
{@link com.sun.jdi.request.BreakpointRequest} is used to request a
{@link com.sun.jdi.event.BreakpointEvent BreakpointEvent}.
Event requests are created by the 
{@link com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequestManager}.  
Events and event processing are defined in the
{@link com.sun.jdi.event} package.
<p>
Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future 
releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard 
extension.
