/**
 * <p>An object of this class implements the MBeanServerAccessController
 * interface and, for each of its methods, calls an appropriate checking
 * method and then forwards the request to a wrapped MBeanServer object.
 * The checking method may throw a SecurityException if the operation is
 * not allowed; in this case the request is not forwarded to the
 * wrapped object.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements the {@link #checkRead()} and {@link #checkWrite()}
 * methods based on an access level properties file containing username/access
 * level pairs. The set of username/access level pairs is passed either as a
 * filename which denotes a properties file on disk, or directly as an instance
 * of the {@link Properties} class.  In both cases, the name of each property
 * represents a username, and the value of the property is the associated access
 * level.  Thus, any given username either does not exist in the properties or
 * has exactly one access level. The same access level can be shared by several
 * usernames.</p>
 *
 * <p>The supported access level values are <i>readonly</i> and
 * <i>readwrite</i>.</p>
