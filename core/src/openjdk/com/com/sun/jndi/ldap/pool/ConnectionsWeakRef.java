 * The ConnectionsRef is for cleaning up the resources held by the
 * Connection thread by making them available to the GC. The pool
 * uses ConnectionRef to hold the pooled resources.
 *
 * This class in turn holds a WeakReference with a ReferenceQueue to the
 * ConnectionRef to track when the ConnectionRef becomes ready
 * for getting GC'ed. It extends from WeakReference in order to hold a
 * reference to Connections used for closing (which in turn terminates
 * the Connection thread) it by monitoring the ReferenceQueue.
