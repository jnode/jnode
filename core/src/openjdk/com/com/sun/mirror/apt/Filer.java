/**
 * This interface supports the creation of new files by an
 * annotation processor.
 * Files created in this way will be known to the annotation processing
 * tool implementing this interface, better enabling the tool to manage them.
 * Four kinds of files are distinguished:
 * source files, class files, other text files, and other binary files.
 * The latter two are collectively referred to as <i>auxiliary</i> files.
 *
 * <p> There are two distinguished locations (subtrees within the
 * file system) where newly created files are placed:
 * one for new source files, and one for new class files.
 * (These might be specified on a tool's command line, for example,
 * using flags such as <tt>-s</tt> and <tt>-d</tt>.)
 * Auxiliary files may be created in either location.
 *
 * <p> During each run of an annotation processing tool, a file
 * with a given pathname may be created only once.  If that file already
 * exists before the first attempt to create it, the old contents will
 * be deleted.  Any subsequent attempt to create the same file during
 * a run will fail.
