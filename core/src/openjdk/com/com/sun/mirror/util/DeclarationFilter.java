/**
 * A filter for selecting just the items of interest
 * from a collection of declarations.
 * The filter is said to <i>select</i> or to <i>match</i> those declarations.
 * Filters can be created in several ways:
 * by the static methods described below,
 * by negating or composing existing filters,
 * or by subclasses that implement arbitrary matching rules.
 *
 * <p> A subclass can create an arbitrary filter simply by implementing
 * the {@link #matches(Declaration)} method.
 *
 * <p> Examples.
 * <p> Selecting the <tt>public</tt> declarations from a collection:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     result = FILTER_PUBLIC.filter(decls);		</pre></blockquote>
 * Selecting class declarations (including enums):
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     classFilter = DeclarationFilter.getFilter(ClassDeclaration.class);
 *     result = classFilter.filter(decls);		</pre></blockquote>
 * Selecting class declarations but excluding enums:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     enumFilter = DeclarationFilter.getFilter(EnumDeclaration.class);
 *     compoundFilter = classFilter.and(enumFilter.not());
 *     result = compoundFilter.filter(decls);		</pre></blockquote>
 * Selecting declarations named "Bob":
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     nameFilter = new DeclarationFilter() {
 *                      public boolean matches(Declaration d) {
 *                          return d.getSimpleName().equals("Bob");
 *                      }
 *                  };
 *     result = nameFilter.filter(decls);		</pre></blockquote>
