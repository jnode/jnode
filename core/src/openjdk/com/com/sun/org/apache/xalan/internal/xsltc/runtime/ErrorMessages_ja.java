/*
 * XSLTC run-time error messages.
 *
 * General notes to translators and definitions:
 *
 *   1) XSLTC is the name of the product.  It is an acronym for XML Stylesheet:
 *      Transformations Compiler
 *
 *   2) A stylesheet is a description of how to transform an input XML document
 *      into a resultant output XML document (or HTML document or text)
 *
 *   3) An axis is a particular "dimension" in a tree representation of an XML
 *      document; the nodes in the tree are divided along different axes.
 *      Traversing the "child" axis, for instance, means that the program
 *      would visit each child of a particular node; traversing the "descendant"
 *      axis means that the program would visit the child nodes of a particular
 *      node, their children, and so on until the leaf nodes of the tree are
 *      reached.
 *
 *   4) An iterator is an object that traverses nodes in a tree along a
 *      particular axis, one at a time.
 *
 *   5) An element is a mark-up tag in an XML document; an attribute is a
 *      modifier on the tag.  For example, in <elem attr='val' attr2='val2'>
 *      "elem" is an element name, "attr" and "attr2" are attribute names with
 *      the values "val" and "val2", respectively.
 *
 *   6) A namespace declaration is a special attribute that is used to associate
 *      a prefix with a URI (the namespace).  The meanings of element names and
 *      attribute names that use that prefix are defined with respect to that
 *      namespace.
 *
 *   7) DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model.  It is a tree
 *      representation of an XML document.
 *
 *      SAX is an acronym for the Simple API for XML processing.  It is an API
 *      used inform an XML processor (in this case XSLTC) of the structure and
 *      content of an XML document.
 *
 *      Input to the stylesheet processor can come from an XML parser in the
 *      form of a DOM tree or through the SAX API.
 *
 *   8) DTD is a document type declaration.  It is a way of specifying the
 *      grammar for an XML file, the names and types of elements, attributes,
 *      etc.
