/**
 * The superclass for all builders.  A builder is a class that provides
 * the structure and content of API documentation.  A builder is completely
 * doclet independent which means that any doclet can use builders to
 * construct documentation, as long as it impelements the appropriate
 * writer interfaces.  For example, if a doclet wanted to use 
 * {@link ConstantsSummaryBuilder} to build a constant summary, all it has to
 * do is implement the ConstantsSummaryWriter interface and pass it to the 
 * builder using a WriterFactory.
 *
 * This code is not part of an API.
 * It is implementation that is subject to change.
 * Do not use it as an API
