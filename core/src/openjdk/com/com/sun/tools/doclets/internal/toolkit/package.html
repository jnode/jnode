        Contains the base classes that make up a doclet.  Doclets that reuse
        the functionality provided by the toolkit should have the following
        characteristics:
        <ul>
            <li> 
                The main driver class should extend 
                {@link com.sun.tools.doclets.internal.toolkit.AbstractDoclet}.
            </li>
            <li> 
                The doclet configuration class should extend 
                {@link com.sun.tools.doclets.internal.toolkit.Configuration}.
            </li>
            <li> 
                The doclet should have a writer factory that implements
                {@link com.sun.tools.doclets.internal.toolkit.WriterFactory}.  
                This class constructs writers that write doclet specific output.
            </li>
            <li> 
                The doclet should have a taglet writer that extends
                {@link com.sun.tools.doclets.internal.toolkit.taglets.TagletWriter}. 
                 This writer determines how to output each given tag.
            </li>
