API for programatic invocation of XJC and schemagen.

<p>
This package provides a way to invoke XJC from within another program.
The primarily target of this API is the JAX-WS RI, but we hope that
this API would be useful for other integration purposes as well.

<h2>Getting Started: Using XJC</h2>
<p>
To invoke XJC, a typical client would do something like this:
<pre>
    SchemaCompiler sc = XJC.createSchemaCompiler();
    sc.parseSchema(new InputSource(schema1Url.toExternalForm()));
    sc.parseSchema(new InputSource(schema2Url.toExternalForm()));
    ...
    S2JModel model = sc.bind();
</pre>
<p>
The bind operation causes XJC to do the bulk of the work, such as
figuring out what classes to generate, what methods/fields to generate, etc.
The obtained model contains useful introspective information about
how the binding was performed (such as relationship between XML types
and generated Java classes)

<p>
Once the model is obtained, generate the code into the file system as follows:
<pre>
    JCodeModel cm = model.generateCode( null, ... );
    cm.build(new FileCodeWriter(outputDir));
</pre>


<h2>Implementation Note</h2>
<p>
This package shouldn't contain any implementation code.
