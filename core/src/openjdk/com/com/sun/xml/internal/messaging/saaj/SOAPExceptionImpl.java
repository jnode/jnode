 * that gives the reason for the exception, an embedded
 * <code>Throwable</code> object, or both. This class provides methods
 * for retrieving reason messages and for retrieving the embedded

 * object are problems such as difficulty setting a header, not being
 * able to send a message, and not being able to get a connection with
 * the provider.  Reasons for embedding a <code>Throwable</code>
 * object include problems such as input/output errors or a parsing
 * problem, such as an error in parsing a header.
