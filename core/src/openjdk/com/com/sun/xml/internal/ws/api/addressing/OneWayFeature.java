 * Unsupported RI extension to work around an issue in WSIT.

 * <b>This feature is not meant to be used by a common Web service developer</b> as there
 * is no need to send the above mentioned header for a one-way operation. But these
 * properties may need to be sent in certain middleware Web services.
 *
 * <p>
 * This feature allows ReplyTo, From and RelatesTo Message Addressing Properties
 * to be added for all messages that are sent from the port configured with
 * this annotation. All operations are assumed to be one-way, and
 * this feature should be used for one-way
 * operations only.
 * 
 * If a non-null ReplyTo is specified, then MessageID property is also added.
