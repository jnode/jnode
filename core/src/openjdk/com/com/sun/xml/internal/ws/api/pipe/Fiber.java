/**
 * User-level thread&#x2E; Represents the execution of one request/response processing.
 *
 * <p>
 * JAX-WS RI is capable of running a large number of request/response concurrently by
 * using a relatively small number of threads. This is made possible by utilizing
 * a {@link Fiber} &mdash; a user-level thread that gets created for each request/response
 * processing.
 *
 * <p>
 * A fiber remembers where in the pipeline the processing is at, what needs to be
 * executed on the way out (when processing response), and other additional information
 * specific to the execution of a particular request/response.
 *
 * <h2>Suspend/Resume</h2>
 * <p>
 * Fiber can be {@link NextAction#suspend() suspended} by a {@link Tube}.
 * When a fiber is suspended, it will be kept on the side until it is
 * {@link #resume(Packet) resumed}. This allows threads to go execute
 * other runnable fibers, allowing efficient utilization of smaller number of
 * threads.
 *
 * <h2>Context-switch Interception</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link FiberContextSwitchInterceptor} allows {@link Tube}s and {@link Adapter}s
 * to perform additional processing every time a thread starts running a fiber
 * and stops running it.
 *
 * <h2>Context ClassLoader</h2>
 * <p>
 * Just like thread, a fiber has a context class loader (CCL.) A fiber's CCL
 * becomes the thread's CCL when it's executing the fiber. The original CCL
 * of the thread will be restored when the thread leaves the fiber execution.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Debugging Aid</h2>
 * <p>
 * Because {@link Fiber} doesn't keep much in the call stack, and instead use
 * {@link #conts} to store the continuation, debugging fiber related activities
 * could be harder.
 *
 * <p>
 * Setting the {@link #LOGGER} for FINE would give you basic start/stop/resume/suspend
 * level logging. Using FINER would cause more detailed logging, which includes
 * what tubes are executed in what order and how they behaved.
 *
 * <p>
 * When you debug the server side, consider setting {@link Fiber#serializeExecution}
 * to true, so that execution of fibers are serialized. Debugging a server
 * with more than one running threads is very tricky, and this switch will
 * prevent that. This can be also enabled by setting the system property on.
 * See the source code.
