/**
 * Root object that hosts the {@link Packet} processing code
 * at the server.
 *
 * <p>
 * One instance of {@link WSEndpoint} is created for each deployed service
 * endpoint. A hosted service usually handles multiple concurrent
 * requests. To do this efficiently, an endpoint handles incoming
 * {@link Packet} through {@link PipeHead}s, where many copies can be created
 * for each endpoint.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each {@link PipeHead} is thread-unsafe, and request needs to be
 * serialized. A {@link PipeHead} represents a sizable resource
 * (in particular a whole pipeline), so the caller is expected to
 * reuse them and avoid excessive allocations as much as possible.
 * Making {@link PipeHead}s thread-unsafe allow the JAX-WS RI internal to
 * tie thread-local resources to {@link PipeHead}, and reduce the total
 * resource management overhead.
 *
 * <p>
 * To abbreviate this resource management (and for a few other reasons),
 * JAX-WS RI provides {@link Adapter} class. If you are hosting a JAX-WS
 * service, you'll most likely want to send requests to {@link WSEndpoint}
 * through {@link Adapter}.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link WSEndpoint} is ready to handle {@link Packet}s as soon as
 * it's created. No separate post-initialization step is necessary.
 * However, to comply with the JAX-WS spec requirement, the caller
 * is expected to call the {@link #dispose()} method to allow an
 * orderly shut-down of a hosted service.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3>Objects Exposed From Endpoint</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link WSEndpoint} exposes a series of information that represents
 * how an endpoint is configured to host a service. See the getXXX methods
 * for more details.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link WSEndpoint} owns a {@link WSWebServiceContext} implementation.
 * But a bulk of the work is delegated to {@link WebServiceContextDelegate},
 * which is passed in as a parameter to {@link PipeHead#process(Packet, WebServiceContextDelegate, TransportBackChannel)}.
