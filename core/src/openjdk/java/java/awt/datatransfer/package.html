Provides interfaces and classes for transferring data
between and within applications.  It defines the notion of a
"transferable" object, which is an object capable of being
transferred between or within applications. An object identifies
itself as being transferable by implementing the Transferable
interface.
<p>
It also provides a clipboard mechanism, which is an object that
temporarily holds a transferable object that can be transferred
between or within an application. The clipboard is typically used
for copy and paste operations. Although it is possible to create
a clipboard to use within an application, most applications will
use the system clipboard to ensure the data can be transferred
across applications running on the platform.
