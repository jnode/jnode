/**
 * The listener interface for receiving "interesting" mouse events 
 * (press, release, click, enter, and exit) on a component.
 * (To track mouse moves and mouse drags, use the
 * <code>MouseMotionListener</code>.)
 * <P>
 * The class that is interested in processing a mouse event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract <code>MouseAdapter</code> class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * <P>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's <code>addMouseListener</code> 
 * method. A mouse event is generated when the mouse is pressed, released
 * clicked (pressed and released). A mouse event is also generated when
 * the mouse cursor enters or leaves a component. When a mouse event
 * occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and 
 * the <code>MouseEvent</code> is passed to it.
