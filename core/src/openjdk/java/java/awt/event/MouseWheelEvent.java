/**
 * An event which indicates that the mouse wheel was rotated in a component.
 * <P>
 * A wheel mouse is a mouse which has a wheel in place of the middle button.
 * This wheel can be rotated towards or away from the user.  Mouse wheels are
 * most often used for scrolling, though other uses are possible.
 * <P>
 * A MouseWheelEvent object is passed to every <code>MouseWheelListener</code>
 * object which registered to receive the "interesting" mouse events using the
 * component's <code>addMouseWheelListener</code> method.  Each such listener
 * object gets a <code>MouseEvent</code> containing the mouse event.
 * <P>
 * Due to the mouse wheel's special relationship to scrolling Components,
 * MouseWheelEvents are delivered somewhat differently than other MouseEvents.
 * This is because while other MouseEvents usually affect a change on 
 * the Component directly under the mouse
 * cursor (for instance, when clicking a button), MouseWheelEvents often have
 * an effect away from the mouse cursor (moving the wheel while
 * over a Component inside a ScrollPane should scroll one of the
 * Scrollbars on the ScrollPane).
 * <P>
 * MouseWheelEvents start delivery from the Component underneath the
 * mouse cursor.  If MouseWheelEvents are not enabled on the
 * Component, the event is delivered to the first ancestor 
 * Container with MouseWheelEvents enabled.  This will usually be
 * a ScrollPane with wheel scrolling enabled.  The source
 * Component and x,y coordinates will be relative to the event's
 * final destination (the ScrollPane).  This allows a complex
 * GUI to be installed without modification into a ScrollPane, and
 * for all MouseWheelEvents to be delivered to the ScrollPane for
 * scrolling.
 * <P>
 * Some AWT Components are implemented using native widgets which
 * display their own scrollbars and handle their own scrolling.  
 * The particular Components for which this is true will vary from
 * platform to platform.  When the mouse wheel is
 * moved over one of these Components, the event is delivered straight to
 * the native widget, and not propagated to ancestors.
 * <P>
 * Platforms offer customization of the amount of scrolling that
 * should take place when the mouse wheel is moved.  The two most
 * common settings are to scroll a certain number of "units"
 * (commonly lines of text in a text-based component) or an entire "block"
 * (similar to page-up/page-down).  The MouseWheelEvent offers
 * methods for conforming to the underlying platform settings.  These
 * platform settings can be changed at any time by the user.  MouseWheelEvents
 * reflect the most recent settings.
