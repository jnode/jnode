Contains all of the classes for creating user
interfaces and for painting graphics and images. A user interface object such as a button or a
scrollbar is called, in AWT terminology, a component. The Component class is the root of all
AWT components. See Component for a detailed description of properties that all AWT 
components share.
<p>
Some components fire events when a user interacts with the components. The AWTEvent
class and its subclasses are used to represent the events that AWT components can fire. See
AWTEvent for a description of the AWT event model.
<p>
A container is a component that can contain components and other containers. A con
tainer can also have a layout manager that controls the visual placement of components in the
container. The AWT package contains several layout manager classes and an interface for
building your own layout manager. See Container and LayoutManager for more information.
<p>
Each {@code Component} object is limited in its maximum size and
its location because the values are stored as an integer.
Also, a platform may further restrict maximum size and location
coordinates. The exact maximum values are dependent on the platform.
There is no way to change these maximum values, either in Java
code or in native code.
These limitations also impose restrictions on component layout.
If the bounds of a Component object exceed a platform limit,
there is no way to properly arrange them within a Container object.
The object's bounds are defined by any object's coordinate
in combination with its size on a respective axis.
