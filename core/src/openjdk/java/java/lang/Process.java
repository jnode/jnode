/**
 * The {@link ProcessBuilder#start()} and
 * {@link Runtime#exec(String[],String[],File) Runtime.exec}
 * methods create a native process and return an instance of a
 * subclass of {@code Process} that can be used to control the process
 * and obtain information about it.  The class {@code Process}
 * provides methods for performing input from the process, performing
 * output to the process, waiting for the process to complete,
 * checking the exit status of the process, and destroying (killing)
 * the process.
 *
 * <p>The methods that create processes may not work well for special
 * processes on certain native platforms, such as native windowing
 * processes, daemon processes, Win16/DOS processes on Microsoft
 * Windows, or shell scripts.  The created subprocess does not have
 * its own terminal or console.  All its standard I/O (i.e. stdin,
 * stdout, stderr) operations will be redirected to the parent process
 * through three streams
 * ({@link #getOutputStream()},
 * {@link #getInputStream()},
 * {@link #getErrorStream()}).
 * The parent process uses these streams to feed input to and get output
 * from the subprocess. Because some native platforms only provide
 * limited buffer size for standard input and output streams, failure
 * to promptly write the input stream or read the output stream of
 * the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block, and even deadlock.
 *
 * <p>The subprocess is not killed when there are no more references to
 * the {@code Process} object, but rather the subprocess
 * continues executing asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>There is no requirement that a process represented by a {@code
 * Process} object execute asynchronously or concurrently with respect
 * to the Java process that owns the {@code Process} object.
