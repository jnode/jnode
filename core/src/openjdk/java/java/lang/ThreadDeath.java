/**
 * An instance of <code>ThreadDeath</code> is thrown in the victim 
 * thread when the <code>stop</code> method with zero arguments in

 * <p>
 * An application should catch instances of this class only if it 
 * must clean up after being terminated asynchronously. If 
 * <code>ThreadDeath</code> is caught by a method, it is important 
 * that it be rethrown so that the thread actually dies. 
 * <p>
 * The top-level error handler does not print out a message if 
 * <code>ThreadDeath</code> is never caught. 
 * <p>
 * The class <code>ThreadDeath</code> is specifically a subclass of 
 * <code>Error</code> rather than <code>Exception</code>, even though 
 * it is a "normal occurrence", because many applications 
 * catch all occurrences of <code>Exception</code> and then discard 
 * the exception.
