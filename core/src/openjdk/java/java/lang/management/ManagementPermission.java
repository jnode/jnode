 * <tr>
 *   <td>control</td>
 *   <td>Ability to control the runtime characteristics of the Java virtual
 *       machine, for example, setting the -verbose:gc and -verbose:class flag,
 *       setting the threshold of a memory pool, and enabling and disabling
 *       the thread contention monitoring support. 
 *   </td>
 *   <td>This allows an attacker to control the runtime characteristics

 *   <td>monitor</td>
 *   <td>Ability to retrieve runtime information about 
 *       the Java virtual machine such as thread
 *       stack trace, a list of all loaded class names, and input arguments
 *       to the Java virtual machine.</td>
