/**
 * Represents an annotated element of the program currently running in this
 * VM.  This interface allows annotations to be read reflectively.  All
 * annotations returned by methods in this interface are immutable and
 * serializable.  It is permissible for the caller to modify the
 * arrays returned by accessors for array-valued enum members; it will
 * have no affect on the arrays returned to other callers.
 *
 * <p>If an annotation returned by a method in this interface contains
 * (directly or indirectly) a {@link Class}-valued member referring to
 * a class that is not accessible in this VM, attempting to read the class
 * by calling the relevant Class-returning method on the returned annotation
 * will result in a {@link TypeNotPresentException}.
 *
 * <p>Similarly, attempting to read an enum-valued member will result in
 * a {@link EnumConstantNotPresentException} if the enum constant in the
 * annotation is no longer present in the enum type.
 * 
 * <p>Finally, Attempting to read a member whose definition has evolved
 * incompatibly will result in a {@link
 * java.lang.annotation.AnnotationTypeMismatchException} or an
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.IncompleteAnnotationException}.
