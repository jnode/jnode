/**
 * Used for exporting a remote object with JRMP and obtaining a stub
 * that communicates to the remote object.
 *
 * <p>For the constructors and static <code>exportObject</code> methods
 * below, the stub for a remote object being exported is obtained as
 * follows:
 *
 * <p><ul>
 *
 * <li>If the remote object is exported using the {@link
 * #exportObject(Remote) UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(Remote)} method,
 * a stub class (typically pregenerated from the remote object's class
 * using the <code>rmic</code> tool) is loaded and an instance of that stub
 * class is constructed as follows.
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>A "root class" is determined as follows:  if the remote object's
 * class directly implements an interface that extends {@link Remote}, then
 * the remote object's class is the root class; otherwise, the root class is
 * the most derived superclass of the remote object's class that directly
 * implements an interface that extends <code>Remote</code>.
 *
 * <li>The name of the stub class to load is determined by concatenating
 * the binary name of the root class with the suffix <code>"_Stub"</code>.
 *
 * <li>The stub class is loaded by name using the class loader of the root
 * class.  The stub class must extend {@link RemoteStub} and must have a
 * public constructor that has one parameter, of type {@link RemoteRef}.
 *
 * <li>Finally, an instance of the stub class is constructed with a
 * {@link RemoteRef}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <li>If the appropriate stub class could not be found, or the stub class
 * could not be loaded, or a problem occurs creating the stub instance, a
 * {@link StubNotFoundException} is thrown.
 *
 * <p>
 * <li>For all other means of exporting:
 * <p><ul>
 *
 * <li>If the remote object's stub class (as defined above) could not be
 * loaded or the system property
 * <code>java.rmi.server.ignoreStubClasses</code> is set to
 * <code>"true"</code> (case insensitive), a {@link
 * java.lang.reflect.Proxy} instance is constructed with the following
 * properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>The proxy's class is defined by the class loader of the remote
 * object's class.
 *
 * <li>The proxy implements all the remote interfaces implemented by the
 * remote object's class.
 *
 * <li>The proxy's invocation handler is a {@link
 * RemoteObjectInvocationHandler} instance constructed with a
 * {@link RemoteRef}.
 *
 * <li>If the proxy could not be created, a {@link StubNotFoundException}
 * will be thrown.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <li>Otherwise, an instance of the remote object's stub class (as
 * described above) is used as the stub.
 *
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
