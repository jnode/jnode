/**
 * A <code>DomainCombiner</code> provides a means to dynamically
 * update the ProtectionDomains associated with the current
 * <code>AccessControlContext</code>.
 *
 * <p> A <code>DomainCombiner</code> is passed as a parameter to the
 * appropriate constructor for <code>AccessControlContext</code>.
 * The newly constructed context is then passed to the
 * <code>AccessController.doPrivileged(..., context)</code> method
 * to bind the provided context (and associated <code>DomainCombiner</code>)
 * with the current execution Thread.  Subsequent calls to
 * <code>AccessController.getContext</code> or
 * <code>AccessController.checkPermission</code>
 * cause the <code>DomainCombiner.combine</code> to get invoked.
 *
 * <p> The combine method takes two arguments.  The first argument represents
 * an array of ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread,
 * since the most recent call to <code>AccessController.doPrivileged</code>.
 * If no call to doPrivileged was made, then the first argument will contain
 * all the ProtectionDomains from the current execution Thread.
 * The second argument represents an array of inherited ProtectionDomains,
 * which may be <code>null</code>.  ProtectionDomains may be inherited
 * from a parent Thread, or from a privileged context.  If no call to
 * doPrivileged was made, then the second argument will contain the
 * ProtectionDomains inherited from the parent Thread.  If one or more calls
 * to doPrivileged were made, and the most recent call was to
 * doPrivileged(action, context), then the second argument will contain the
 * ProtectionDomains from the privileged context.  If the most recent call
 * was to doPrivileged(action), then there is no privileged context,
 * and the second argument will be <code>null</code>.
 *
 * <p> The <code>combine</code> method investigates the two input arrays
 * of ProtectionDomains and returns a single array containing the updated
 * ProtectionDomains.  In the simplest case, the <code>combine</code>
 * method merges the two stacks into one.  In more complex cases,
 * the <code>combine</code> method returns a modified
 * stack of ProtectionDomains.  The modification may have added new
 * ProtectionDomains, removed certain ProtectionDomains, or simply
 * updated existing ProtectionDomains.  Re-ordering and other optimizations
 * to the ProtectionDomains are also permitted.  Typically the
 * <code>combine</code> method bases its updates on the information
 * encapsulated in the <code>DomainCombiner</code>.
 *
 * <p> After the <code>AccessController.getContext</code> method
 * receives the combined stack of ProtectionDomains back from
 * the <code>DomainCombiner</code>, it returns a new
 * AccessControlContext that has both the combined ProtectionDomains
 * as well as the <code>DomainCombiner</code>.
 * 
 * @see AccessController
 * @see AccessControlContext
 * @since 1.3
