 * The <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)

 * <code>CertPathValidator</code> implementations must include a class (the
 * SPI class) that extends this class (<code>CertPathValidatorSpi</code>) 
 * and implements all of its methods. In general, instances of this class 
 * should only be accessed through the <code>CertPathValidator</code> class. 
 * For details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture.
 * <p>
 * <b>Concurrent Access</b>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class need not be protected against concurrent
 * access from multiple threads. Threads that need to access a single
 * <code>CertPathValidatorSpi</code> instance concurrently should synchronize
 * amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking before calling the
 * wrapping <code>CertPathValidator</code> object.
 * <p>
 * However, implementations of <code>CertPathValidatorSpi</code> may still
 * encounter concurrency issues, since multiple threads each
 * manipulating a different <code>CertPathValidatorSpi</code> instance need not
 * synchronize.
