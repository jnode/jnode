/**
 * The <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
 * for the {@link CertStore CertStore} class. All <code>CertStore</code>
 * implementations must include a class (the SPI class) that extends
 * this class (<code>CertStoreSpi</code>), provides a constructor with
 * a single argument of type <code>CertStoreParameters</code>, and implements 
 * all of its methods. In general, instances of this class should only be
 * accessed through the <code>CertStore</code> class. 
 * For details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture.
 * <p>
 * <b>Concurrent Access</b>
 * <p>
 * The public methods of all <code>CertStoreSpi</code> objects must be 
 * thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke these 
 * methods on a single <code>CertStoreSpi</code> object (or more than one) 
 * with no ill effects. This allows a <code>CertPathBuilder</code> to search 
 * for a CRL while simultaneously searching for further certificates, for 
 * instance.
 * <p>
 * Simple <code>CertStoreSpi</code> implementations will probably ensure
 * thread safety by adding a <code>synchronized</code> keyword to their
 * <code>engineGetCertificates</code> and <code>engineGetCRLs</code> methods.
 * More sophisticated ones may allow truly concurrent access.
