/**
 * This class defines the functionality of a certificate factory, which is
 * used to generate certificate, certification path (<code>CertPath</code>)
 * and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from their encodings.
 *
 * <p>For encodings consisting of multiple certificates, use
 * <code>generateCertificates</code> when you want to
 * parse a collection of possibly unrelated certificates. Otherwise,
 * use <code>generateCertPath</code> when you want to generate
 * a <code>CertPath</code> (a certificate chain) and subsequently
 * validate it with a <code>CertPathValidator</code>.
 *
 * <p>A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an
 * instance of <code>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</code>, and CRLs
 * that are an instance of <code>java.security.cert.X509CRL</code>.
 *
 * <p>The following example reads a file with Base64 encoded certificates,
 * which are each bounded at the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and
 * bounded at the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----. We convert the
 * <code>FileInputStream</code> (which does not support <code>mark</code>
 * and <code>reset</code>) to a <code>BufferedInputStream</code> (which
 * supports those methods), so that each call to
 * <code>generateCertificate</code> consumes only one certificate, and the
 * read position of the input stream is positioned to the next certificate in
 * the file:<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
 * BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);
 *
 * CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
 *
 * while (bis.available() > 0) {
 *    Certificate cert = cf.generateCertificate(bis);
 *    System.out.println(cert.toString());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The following example parses a PKCS#7-formatted certificate reply stored
 * in a file and extracts all the certificates from it:<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
 * CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
 * Collection c = cf.generateCertificates(fis);
 * Iterator i = c.iterator();
 * while (i.hasNext()) {
 *    Certificate cert = (Certificate)i.next();
 *    System.out.println(cert);
 * }
 * </pre>
