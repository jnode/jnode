/**
 * Parameters used as input for the PKIX <code>CertPathBuilder</code> 
 * algorithm.
 * <p>
 * A PKIX <code>CertPathBuilder</code> uses these parameters to {@link 
 * CertPathBuilder#build build} a <code>CertPath</code> which has been 
 * validated according to the PKIX certification path validation algorithm.
 *
 * <p>To instantiate a <code>PKIXBuilderParameters</code> object, an
 * application must specify one or more <i>most-trusted CAs</i> as defined by
 * the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA 
 * can be specified using one of two constructors. An application 
 * can call {@link #PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector) 
 * PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector)}, specifying a 
 * <code>Set</code> of <code>TrustAnchor</code> objects, each of which 
 * identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call 
 * {@link #PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector)
 * PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector)}, specifying a 
 * <code>KeyStore</code> instance containing trusted certificate entries, each 
 * of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.
 *
 * <p>In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target 
 * certificate that the <code>CertPathBuilder</code> will attempt 
 * to build a path to. The constraints are specified as a 
 * <code>CertSelector</code> object. These constraints should provide the 
 * <code>CertPathBuilder</code> with enough search criteria to find the target 
 * certificate. Minimal criteria for an <code>X509Certificate</code> usually 
 * include the subject name and/or one or more subject alternative names.
 * If enough criteria is not specified, the <code>CertPathBuilder</code> 
 * may throw a <code>CertPathBuilderException</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Concurrent Access</b>
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 * separate objects need not synchronize.
