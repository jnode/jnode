/**
 * An abstract class that performs one or more checks on an 
 * <code>X509Certificate</code>. 
 * 
 * <p>A concrete implementation of the <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code> class 
 * can be created to extend the PKIX certification path validation algorithm.
 * For example, an implementation may check for and process a critical private
 * extension of each certificate in a certification path.
 *
 * <p>Instances of <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code> are passed as parameters
 * using the {@link PKIXParameters#setCertPathCheckers setCertPathCheckers}
 * or {@link PKIXParameters#addCertPathChecker addCertPathChecker} methods 
 * of the <code>PKIXParameters</code> and <code>PKIXBuilderParameters</code>
 * class. Each of the <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code>s {@link #check check}
 * methods will be called, in turn, for each certificate processed by a PKIX 
 * <code>CertPathValidator</code> or <code>CertPathBuilder</code> 
 * implementation.
 * 
 * <p>A <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code> may be called multiple times on 
 * successive certificates in a certification path. Concrete subclasses
 * are expected to maintain any internal state that may be necessary to 
 * check successive certificates. The {@link #init init} method is used 
 * to initialize the internal state of the checker so that the certificates 
 * of a new certification path may be checked. A stateful implementation
 * <b>must</b> override the {@link #clone clone} method if necessary in 
 * order to allow a PKIX <code>CertPathBuilder</code> to efficiently 
 * backtrack and try other paths. In these situations, the 
 * <code>CertPathBuilder</code> is able to restore prior path validation 
 * states by restoring the cloned <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code>s.
 *
 * <p>The order in which the certificates are presented to the 
 * <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code> may be either in the forward direction 
 * (from target to most-trusted CA) or in the reverse direction (from 
 * most-trusted CA to target). A <code>PKIXCertPathChecker</code> implementation
 * <b>must</b> support reverse checking (the ability to perform its checks when
 * it is presented with certificates in the reverse direction) and <b>may</b> 
 * support forward checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is 
 * presented with certificates in the forward direction). The 
 * {@link #isForwardCheckingSupported isForwardCheckingSupported} method 
 * indicates whether forward checking is supported.
 * <p>
 * Additional input parameters required for executing the check may be 
 * specified through constructors of concrete implementations of this class.
 * <p>
 * <b>Concurrent Access</b>
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 * separate objects need not synchronize.

 * @see PKIXBuilderParameters
