/**
 * A trust anchor or most-trusted Certification Authority (CA).
 * <p>
 * This class represents a "most-trusted CA", which is used as a trust anchor
 * for validating X.509 certification paths. A most-trusted CA includes the 
 * public key of the CA, the CA's name, and any constraints upon the set of 
 * paths which may be validated using this key. These parameters can be
 * specified in the form of a trusted <code>X509Certificate</code> or as
 * individual parameters.
 * <p>
 * <b>Concurrent Access</b>
 * <p>
 * <p>All <code>TrustAnchor</code> objects must be immutable and
 * thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke the
 * methods defined in this class on a single <code>TrustAnchor</code>
 * object (or more than one) with no ill effects. Requiring
 * <code>TrustAnchor</code> objects to be immutable and thread-safe
 * allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without
 * worrying about coordinating access. This stipulation applies to all 
 * public fields and methods of this class and any added or overridden
 * by subclasses.
