/**
 * Interface for an X.509 extension.
 *
 * <p>The extensions defined for X.509 v3
 * {@link X509Certificate Certificates} and v2
 * {@link X509CRL CRLs} (Certificate Revocation
 * Lists) provide methods
 * for associating additional attributes with users or public keys,
 * for managing the certification hierarchy, and for managing CRL
 * distribution. The X.509 extensions format also allows communities
 * to define private extensions to carry information unique to those
 * communities.
 *
 * <p>Each extension in a certificate/CRL may be designated as
 * critical or non-critical.  A certificate/CRL-using system (an application
 * validating a certificate/CRL) must reject the certificate/CRL if it
 * encounters a critical extension it does not recognize.  A non-critical
 * extension may be ignored if it is not recognized.
 * <p>
 * The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * Extensions  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Extension
 *
 * Extension  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
 *     extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 *     critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
 *     extnValue     OCTET STRING
 *                   -- contains a DER encoding of a value
 *                   -- of the type registered for use with
 *                   -- the extnId object identifier value
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Since not all extensions are known, the <code>getExtensionValue</code>
 * method returns the DER-encoded OCTET STRING of the
 * extension value (i.e., the <code>extnValue</code>). This can then
 * be handled by a <em>Class</em> that understands the extension.
