/**
 * An interface to an object capable of generating DSA key pairs. 
 *
 * <p>The <code>initialize</code> methods may each be called any number 
 * of times. If no <code>initialize</code> method is called on a 
 * DSAKeyPairGenerator, the default is to generate 1024-bit keys, using 
 * precomputed p, q and g parameters and an instance of SecureRandom as 
 * the random bit source.
 * 
 * <p>Users wishing to indicate DSA-specific parameters, and to generate a key 
 * pair suitable for use with the DSA algorithm typically
 * 
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>Get a key pair generator for the DSA algorithm by calling the 
 * KeyPairGenerator <code>getInstance</code> method with "DSA" 
 * as its argument.<p> 
 * 
 * <li>Initialize the generator by casting the result to a DSAKeyPairGenerator
 * and calling one of the 
 * <code>initialize</code> methods from this DSAKeyPairGenerator interface.<p>
 * 
 * <li>Generate a key pair by calling the <code>generateKeyPair</code> 
 * method from the KeyPairGenerator class.
 * 
 * </ol> 
 *
 * <p>Note: it is not always necessary to do do algorithm-specific
 * initialization for a DSA key pair generator. That is, it is not always
 * necessary to call an <code>initialize</code> method in this interface.
 * Algorithm-independent initialization using the <code>initialize</code> method
 * in the KeyPairGenerator
 * interface is all that is needed when you accept defaults for algorithm-specific
 * parameters.
