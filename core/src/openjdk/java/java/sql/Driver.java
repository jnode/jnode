 * The interface that every driver class must implement.
 * <P>The Java SQL framework allows for multiple database drivers.
 *
 * <P>Each driver should supply a class that implements
 * the Driver interface.
 *
 * <P>The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can
 * find and then for any given connection request, it will ask each
 * driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.
 *
 * <P>It is strongly recommended that each Driver class should be
 * small and standalone so that the Driver class can be loaded and
 * queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.
 *
 * <P>When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of
 * itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means that a
 * user can load and register a driver by calling
 * <pre>
 *   <code>Class.forName("foo.bah.Driver")</code>
