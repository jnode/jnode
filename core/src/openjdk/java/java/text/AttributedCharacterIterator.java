/**
 * An AttributedCharacterIterator allows iteration through both text and
 * related attribute information.
 *
 * <p>
 * An attribute is a key/value pair, identified by the key.  No two
 * attributes on a given character can have the same key.
 *
 * <p>The values for an attribute are immutable, or must not be mutated
 * by clients or storage.  They are always passed by reference, and not
 * cloned.
 *
 * <p>A <em>run with respect to an attribute</em> is a maximum text range for
 * which:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the attribute is undefined or null for the entire range, or
 * <li>the attribute value is defined and has the same non-null value for the
 *     entire range.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A <em>run with respect to a set of attributes</em> is a maximum text range for
 * which this condition is met for each member attribute.
 *
 * <p>The returned indexes are limited to the range of the iterator.
 *
 * <p>The returned attribute information is limited to runs that contain
 * the current character.
 *
 * <p>
 * Attribute keys are instances of AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute and its
 * subclasses, such as java.awt.font.TextAttribute.
 *
 * @see AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute
 * @see java.awt.font.TextAttribute
