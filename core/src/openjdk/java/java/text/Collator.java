/**
 * The <code>Collator</code> class performs locale-sensitive
 * <code>String</code> comparison. You use this class to build
 * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>Collator</code> is an abstract base class. Subclasses
 * implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
 * <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>, is currently provided with
 * the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other
 * subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs.
 *
 * <p>
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static
 * factory method, <code>getInstance</code>, to obtain the appropriate
 * <code>Collator</code> object for a given locale. You will only need
 * to look at the subclasses of <code>Collator</code> if you need
 * to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or
 * if you need to modify that strategy.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following example shows how to compare two strings using
 * the <code>Collator</code> for the default locale.
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * // Compare two strings in the default locale
 * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 * if( myCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") < 0 )
 *     System.out.println("abc is less than ABC");
 * else
 *     System.out.println("abc is greater than or equal to ABC");
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can set a <code>Collator</code>'s <em>strength</em> property
 * to determine the level of difference considered significant in
 * comparisons. Four strengths are provided: <code>PRIMARY</code>,
 * <code>SECONDARY</code>, <code>TERTIARY</code>, and <code>IDENTICAL</code>.
 * The exact assignment of strengths to language features is
 * locale dependant.  For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered
 * primary differences, while "e" and "&#283;" are secondary differences,
 * "e" and "E" are tertiary differences and "e" and "e" are identical.
 * The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for
 * US English.
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
 * Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
 * usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
 * if( usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0 ) {
 *     System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * For comparing <code>String</code>s exactly once, the <code>compare</code>
 * method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of
 * <code>String</code>s however, it is generally necessary to compare each
 * <code>String</code> multiple times. In this case, <code>CollationKey</code>s
 * provide better performance. The <code>CollationKey</code> class converts
 * a <code>String</code> to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise
 * against other <code>CollationKey</code>s. A <code>CollationKey</code> is
 * created by a <code>Collator</code> object for a given <code>String</code>.
 * <br>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> <code>CollationKey</code>s from different
 * <code>Collator</code>s can not be compared. See the class description
 * for {@link CollationKey}
 * for an example using <code>CollationKey</code>s.
