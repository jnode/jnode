/**
 * The Level class defines a set of standard logging levels that
 * can be used to control logging output.  The logging Level objects
 * are ordered and are specified by ordered integers.  Enabling logging
 * at a given level also enables logging at all higher levels.
 * <p>
 * Clients should normally use the predefined Level constants such
 * as Level.SEVERE.
 * <p>
 * The levels in descending order are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>SEVERE (highest value)
 * <li>WARNING
 * <li>INFO
 * <li>CONFIG
 * <li>FINE
 * <li>FINER
 * <li>FINEST  (lowest value)
 * </ul>
 * In addition there is a level OFF that can be used to turn
 * off logging, and a level ALL that can be used to enable
 * logging of all messages.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for third parties to define additional logging
 * levels by subclassing Level.  In such cases subclasses should
 * take care to chose unique integer level values and to ensure that 
 * they maintain the Object uniqueness property across serialization
 * by defining a suitable readResolve method.
