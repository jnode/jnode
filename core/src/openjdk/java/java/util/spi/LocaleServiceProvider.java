/**
 * <p>
 * This is the super class of all the locale sensitive service provider 
 * interfaces (SPIs).  
 * <p>
 * Locale sensitive  service provider interfaces are interfaces that 
 * correspond to locale sensitive classes in the <code>java.text</code>
 * and <code>java.util</code> packages. The interfaces enable the 
 * construction of locale sensitive objects and the retrieval of 
 * localized names for these packages. Locale sensitive factory methods 
 * and methods for name retrieval in the <code>java.text</code> and 
 * <code>java.util</code> packages use implementations of the provider 
 * interfaces to offer support for locales beyond the set of locales 
 * supported by the Java runtime environment itself.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Packaging of Locale Sensitive Service Provider Implementations</h4>
 * Implementations of these locale sensitive services are packaged using the 
 * <a href="../../../../technotes/guides/extensions/index.html">Java Extension Mechanism</a>
 * as installed extensions.  A provider identifies itself with a 
 * provider-configuration file in the resource directory META-INF/services, 
 * using the fully qualified provider interface class name as the file name. 
 * The file should contain a list of fully-qualified concrete provider class names, 
 * one per line. A line is terminated by any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage 
 * return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. Space 
 * and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are ignored. 
 * The comment character is '#' ('\u0023'); on each line all characters following 
 * the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 * <p>
 * If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one configuration 
 * file, or is named in the same configuration file more than once, then the 
 * duplicates will be ignored. The configuration file naming a particular provider 
 * need not be in the same jar file or other distribution unit as the provider itself. 
 * The provider must be accessible from the same class loader that was initially 
 * queried to locate the configuration file; this is not necessarily the class loader 
 * that loaded the file. 
 * <p>
 * For example, an implementation of the
 * {@link java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider DateFormatProvider} class should 
 * take the form of a jar file which contains the file: 
 * <pre>
 * META-INF/services/java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider 
 * </pre>
 * And the file <code>java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider</code> should have 
 * a line such as: 
 * <pre>
 * <code>com.foo.DateFormatProviderImpl</code>
 * </pre>
 * which is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing 
 * <code>DateFormatProvider</code>.
 * <h4>Invocation of Locale Sensitive Services</h4>
 * <p>
 * Locale sensitive factory methods and methods for name retrieval in the 
 * <code>java.text</code> and <code>java.util</code> packages invoke 
 * service provider methods when needed to support the requested locale. 
 * The methods first check whether the Java runtime environment itself 
 * supports the requested locale, and use its support if available. 
 * Otherwise, they call the <code>getAvailableLocales()</code> methods of 
 * installed providers for the appropriate interface to find one that 
 * supports the requested locale. If such a provider is found, its other 
 * methods are called to obtain the requested object or name. If neither 
 * the Java runtime environment itself nor an installed provider supports 
 * the requested locale, a fallback locale is constructed by replacing the 
 * first of the variant, country, or language strings of the locale that's 
 * not an empty string with an empty string, and the lookup process is 
 * restarted. In the case that the variant contains one or more '_'s, the 
 * fallback locale is constructed by replacing the variant with a new variant 
 * which eliminates the last '_' and the part following it.  Even if a 
 * fallback occurs, methods that return requested objects or name are 
 * invoked with the original locale before the fallback.The Java runtime 
 * environment must support the root locale for all locale sensitive services 
 * in order to guarantee that this process terminates.
 * <p>
 * Providers of names (but not providers of other objects) are allowed to 
 * return null for some name requests even for locales that they claim to 
 * support by including them in their return value for 
 * <code>getAvailableLocales</code>. Similarly, the Java runtime 
 * environment itself may not have all names for all locales that it 
 * supports. This is because the sets of objects for which names are 
 * requested can be large and vary over time, so that it's not always 
 * feasible to cover them completely. If the Java runtime environment or a 
 * provider returns null instead of a name, the lookup will proceed as 
 * described above as if the locale was not supported.
 * 
 * @since        1.6
