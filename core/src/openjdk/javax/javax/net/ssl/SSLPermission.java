/**
 * This class is for various network permissions.
 * An SSLPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but
 * no actions list; you either have the named permission
 * or you don't.
 * <P>
 * The target name is the name of the network permission (see below). The naming
 * convention follows the  hierarchical property naming convention.
 * Also, an asterisk
 * may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to
 * signify a wildcard match. For example: "foo.*" or "*" is valid,
 * "*foo" or "a*b" is not valid.
 * <P>
 * The following table lists all the possible SSLPermission target names,
 * and for each provides a description of what the permission allows
 * and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
 * <P>
