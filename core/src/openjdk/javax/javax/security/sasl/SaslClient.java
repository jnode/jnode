/**
 * Performs SASL authentication as a client.
 *<p>
 * A protocol library such as one for LDAP gets an instance of this
 * class in order to perform authentication defined by a specific SASL
 * mechanism. Invoking methods on the <tt>SaslClient</tt> instance
 * process challenges and create responses according to the SASL
 * mechanism implemented by the <tt>SaslClient</tt>.
 * As the authentication proceeds, the instance
 * encapsulates the state of a SASL client's authentication exchange. 
 *<p>
 * Here's an example of how an LDAP library might use a <tt>SaslClient</tt>.
 * It first gets an instance of a <tt>SaslClient</tt>:
 *<blockquote><pre>
 * SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,
 *     authorizationId, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
 *</pre></blockquote>
 * It can then proceed to use the client for authentication.
 * For example, an LDAP library might use the client as follows:
 *<blockquote><pre>
 * // Get initial response and send to server
 * byte[] response = (sc.hasInitialResponse() ? sc.evaluateChallenge(new byte[0]) :
 *     null);
 * LdapResult res = ldap.sendBindRequest(dn, sc.getName(), response);
 * while (!sc.isComplete() && 
 *     (res.status == SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS || res.status == SUCCESS)) {
 *     response = sc.evaluateChallenge(res.getBytes());
 *     if (res.status == SUCCESS) {
 *         // we're done; don't expect to send another BIND
 *         if (response != null) {
 * 	       throw new SaslException(
 * 	           "Protocol error: attempting to send response after completion");
 * 	   }
 *         break;
 *     }
 *     res = ldap.sendBindRequest(dn, sc.getName(), response);
 * }
 * if (sc.isComplete() && res.status == SUCCESS) {
 *    String qop = (String) sc.getNegotiatedProperty(Sasl.QOP);
 *    if (qop != null 
 *        && (qop.equalsIgnoreCase("auth-int") 
 *            || qop.equalsIgnoreCase("auth-conf"))) {
 *
 *      // Use SaslClient.wrap() and SaslClient.unwrap() for future
 *      // communication with server
 *	ldap.in = new SecureInputStream(sc, ldap.in);
 *	ldap.out = new SecureOutputStream(sc, ldap.out);
 *    }
 * }
 *</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * If the mechanism has an initial response, the library invokes
 * <tt>evaluateChallenge()</tt> with an empty
 * challenge and to get initial response.
 * Protocols such as IMAP4, which do not include an initial response with
 * their first authentication command to the server, initiates the
 * authentication without first calling <tt>hasInitialResponse()</tt> 
 * or <tt>evaluateChallenge()</tt>.
 * When the server responds to the command, it sends an initial challenge.
 * For a SASL mechanism in which the client sends data first, the server should
 * have issued a challenge with no data. This will then result in a call
 * (on the client) to <tt>evaluateChallenge()</tt> with an empty challenge.
