/**
 * Simple class to load resources using the 1.2
 * security model.  Since the html support is loaded
 * lazily, it's resources are potentially fetched with
 * applet code in the call stack.  By providing this 
 * functionality in a class that is only built on 1.2,
 * reflection can be used from the code that is also
 * built on 1.1 to call this functionality (and avoid
 * the evils of preprocessing).  This functionality
 * is called from HTMLEditorKit.getResourceAsStream.
