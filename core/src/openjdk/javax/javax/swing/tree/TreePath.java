/**
 * Represents a path to a node. A TreePath is an array of Objects that are

 * TreePath is Serializable, but if any
 * components of the path are not serializable, it will not be written
 * out.
 * <p>
 * For further information and examples of using tree paths,

 * <strong>Warning:</strong>
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with

 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
 * has been added to the <code>java.beans</code> package.
