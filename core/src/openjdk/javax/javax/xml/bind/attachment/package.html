        <p>
	This package is implemented by a MIME-based package processor that 
        enables the interpretation and creation of optimized binary data 
        within an MIME-based package format.

        <p>
        Soap MTOM[1], XOP([2][3]) and WS-I AP[4] standardize approaches to 
        optimized transmission of binary datatypes as an attachment.
        To optimally support these standards within a message passing 
        environment, this package enables an integrated solution between 
        a MIME-based package processor and JAXB unmarshall/marshal processes.
