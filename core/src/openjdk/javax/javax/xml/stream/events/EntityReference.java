package javax.xml.stream.events;
/**
 * An interface for handling Entity events.
 * 
 * This event reports entities that have not been resolved
 * and reports their replacement text unprocessed (if
 * available).  This event will be reported if javax.xml.stream.isReplacingEntityReferences 
 * is set to false.  If javax.xml.stream.isReplacingEntityReferences is set to true
 * entity references will be resolved transparently.
 *
 * Entities are handled in two possible ways:
 *
 * (1) If javax.xml.stream.isReplacingEntityReferences is set to true
 * all entity references are resolved and reported as markup transparently.
 * (2) If javax.xml.stream.isReplacingEntityReferences is set to false
 * Entity references are reported as an EntityReference Event.
