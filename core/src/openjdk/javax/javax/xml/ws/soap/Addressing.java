/**
 * <p>
 * This feature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either
 * the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding.  Using this feature
 * with any other binding is NOT required.
 * <p>
 * The following describes the effects of this feature with respect
 * to be enabled or disabled:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> ENABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be enabled.
 *       At runtime, WS-Addressing headers
 *       MUST be consumed by the receiver and produced by the
 *       sender even if the WSDL declares otherwise. The
 *       mustUnderstand="0" attribute MUST be used on the response WS-Addressing
 *       headers. 
 *  <li> DISABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be disabled
 *       even if an associated WSDL specifies otherwise. At runtime,
 *       WS-Addressing headers MUST NOT be used. WS-Addressing may be explicitly
 *       disabled to prevent a JAX-WS implementation from consuming and producing
 *       WS-Addressing headers. If an application
 *       has implemented WS-Addressing itself, it MUST explicitly disable this feature.
*        Not doing so may break compatibility with future versions of JAX-WS.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <code>required</code> property can be used to
 * specify if WS-Addressing headers MUST
 * be present on incoming messages.  By default the
 * <code>required</code> property is <code>false</code>. 
 * <p>
 * The definition of this annotation is incomplete in this release of JAX-WS as
 * there is no standard way to convey the use of WS-Addressing via a WSDL and there is no
 * standard definition for the default value of WS-Addressing <code>Action</code> headers; 
 * however, the runtime behavior of this annotation is well-defined. 
 * It is intended that a future version of 
 * JAX-WS will require the use of the standard mechanism to convey the use
 * of WS-Addressing via WSDL and default values for WS-Addressing <code>Action</code> headers
 * as defined by the W3C WG on WS-Addressing.  
 * <p>
 * To write a portable endpoint and its corresponding client with this version of JAX-WS,
 * an endpoint MUST explicitly specify what WS-Addressing <code>Actions</code> are to be used 
 * via the {@link Action} and {@link FaultAction} annotations.  The client MUST explicitly 
 * enable addresssing via the {@link AddressingFeature}, and for each invocation, the client 
 * MUST explicitly set the {@link BindingProvider#SOAPACTION_URI_PROPERTY}.
 * After the W3C WG on WS-Addressing has specified how the use of WS-Addressing is specified in the WSDL,
 * and what the default value must be for Action headers, a future version of JAX-WS will remove these requirements.
 * <p>
 * See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-core-20060509/">Web Services Addressing - Core</a>
 * and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-soap-20060509/">Web Services Addressing 1.0 - SOAP Binding</a> 
 * for more information on WS-Addressing.
 * 
 * @since JAX-WS 2.1
