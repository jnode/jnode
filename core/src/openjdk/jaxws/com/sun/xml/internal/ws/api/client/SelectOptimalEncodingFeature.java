/**
 * Client side feature to enable or disable the selection of the optimal 
 * encoding by the client when sending outbound messages.
 * <p>
 * The following describes the affects of this feature with respect
 * to being enabled or disabled:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> ENABLED: In this Mode, the most optimal encoding will be selected
 *       depending on the configuration and capabilities of the client
 *       the capabilities of the Web service.
 *  <li> DISABLED: In this Mode, the default encoding will be selected.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If this feature is not present on a Web service then the default behaviour
 * is equivalent to this feature being present and disabled.
 * <p>
 * If this feature is enabled by the client and the Service supports the
 * Fast Infoset encoding, as specified by the {@link FastInfosetFeature},
 * and Fast Infoset is determined to be the most optimal encoding, then the 
 * Fast Infoset encoding will be automatically selected by the client.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Still not sure if a feature is a server side only thing or can 
 * also be a client side thing. If the former then this class should be
 * removed.
