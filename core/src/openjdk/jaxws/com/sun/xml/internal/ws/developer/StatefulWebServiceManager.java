/**
 * Stateful web service support in the JAX-WS RI.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * Application service implementation classes (or providers) who'd like
 * to use the stateful web service support must declare {@link Stateful}
 * annotation on a class. It should also have a <b>public static</b> method/field
 * that takes {@link StatefulWebServiceManager}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;{@link Stateful} &#64;{@link WebService}
 * class BankAccount {
 *     protected final int id;
 *     private int balance;
 *
 *     BankAccount(int id) { this.id = id; }
 *     &#64;{@link WebMethod}
 *     public synchronized void deposit(int amount) { balance+=amount; }
 *
 *     // either via a public static field
 *     <font color=red>
 *     public static {@link StatefulWebServiceManager}&lt;BankAccount> manager;
 *     </font>
 *     // ... or  via a public static method (the method name could be anything)
 *     <font color=red>
 *     public static void setManager({@link StatefulWebServiceManager}&lt;BankAccount> manager) {
 *        ...
 *     }
 *     </font>
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * After your service is deployed but before you receive a first request,
 * the resource injection occurs on the field or the method.
 *
 * <p>
 * A stateful web service class does not need to have a default constructor.
 * In fact, most of the time you want to define a constructor that takes
 * some arguments, so that each instance carries certain state (as illustrated
 * in the above example.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Each instance of a stateful web service class is identified by an unique
 * {@link EndpointReference}. Your application creates an instance of
 * a class, then you'll have the JAX-WS RI assign this unique EPR for the
 * instance as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;{@link WebService}
 * class Bank { // this is ordinary stateless service
 *     &#64;{@link WebMethod}
 *     public synchronized W3CEndpointReference login(int accountId, int pin) {
 *         if(!checkPin(pin))
 *             throw new AuthenticationFailedException("invalid pin");
 *         BankAccount acc = new BankAccount(accountId);
 *         return BankAccount.manager.{@link #export export}(acc);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Typically you then pass this EPR to remote systems. When they send
 * messages to this EPR, the JAX-WS RI makes sure that the particular exported
 * instance associated with that EPR will receive a service invocation.
 *
 * <h2>Things To Consider</h2>
 * <p>
 * When you no longer need to tie an instance to the EPR,
 * use {@link #unexport(Object)} so that the object can be GC-ed
 * (or else you'll leak memory.) You may choose to do so explicitly,
 * or you can rely on the time out by using {@link #setTimeout(long, Callback)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link StatefulWebServiceManager} is thread-safe. It can be safely
 * invoked from multiple threads concurrently.
