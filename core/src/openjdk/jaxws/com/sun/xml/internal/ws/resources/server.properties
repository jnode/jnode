runtime.parser.wsdl.incorrectserviceport=could not get binding from WSDL! service: {0} or port {1} not found in the WSDL {2}.\n\
  It could be because service and port names do not match WSDL''s wsdl:service and wsdl:port names:\n\
    1. service and port names are not there in deployment descriptor OR\n\
    2. Either there is a typo in deployment descriptor''s service and port names OR\n\
    3. The computed names from @WebService do not match wsdl:service and wsdl:port names\n\
  Suggest doing the following:\n\
    1. Add/Correct entries for service and port names in deployment descriptor OR \n\
    2. Specify targetNamespace, serviceName, portName in @WebService on the endpoint class
