/**
 * This feature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either
 * the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding.  Using this feature
 * with any other binding is NOT required.
 * <p>
 * Enabling this feature on the client will cause the JAX-WS runtime
 * to include WS-Addressing headers in SOAP messages.
 * <p>
 * If the web service developer has not explicitly enabled this feature,
 * it MAY be automatically enabled if the associated WSDL enables
 * WS-Addressing with an implementation recognized WSDL extension element.
 * However, in this version of JAX-WS, there is no standard WSDL 
 * extension that a client can rely on to automatically enable WS-Addressing,
 * nor is there a standard default value specified for WS-Addressing 
 * <code>Action</code> headers.
 * <p>
 * To write a portable endpoint and its corresponding client with this 
 * version of JAX-WS, an endpoint MUST explicitly specify what WS-Addressing 
 * <code>Actions</code> are to be used via the {@link Action} and 
 * {@link FaultAction} annotations.  The client MUST explicitly enable 
 * addresssing via this <code>AddressingFeature</code>, and for each invocation, 
 * the client MUST explicitly set the {@link BindingProvider#SOAPACTION_URI_PROPERTY}.
 * After the W3C WG on WS-Addressing has specified how the use of WS-Addressing 
 * is specified in the WSDL, and what the default value must be for Action headers, 
 * a future version of JAX-WS will remove these requirements.
 * <p>
 * See {@link javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature} for more information 
 * on required WSDL extensions.
 * <p>
 * The following describes the effects of this feature with respect
 * to be enabled or disabled:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> ENABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be enabled. 
 *       At runtime, WS-Addressing headers
 *       MUST be consumed by the receiver and produced by the
 *       sender even if the WSDL declares otherwise. The
 *       mustUnderstand="0" attribute MUST be used on the WS-Addressing
 *       headers.
 *  <li> DISABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be disabled
 *       even if an associated WSDL specifies otherwise. At runtime, 
 *       WS-Addressing headers MUST NOT be used.  WS-Addressing may be explicitly
 *       disabled to prevent a JAX-WS implementation from consuming and producing
 *       WS-Addressing headers. If an application
 *       has implemented WS-Addressing itself, it MUST explicitly disable this feature.
*        Not doing so may break compatibility with future versions of JAX-WS.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #required} property can be used to 
 * specify if WS-Addressing headers MUST be present
 * on incoming messages.  This property only has meaning when used on the
 * endpoint and has no affect when used on the client.  
 * By default the
 * <code>required</code> property is <code>false</code>.
  <p>

 * See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-core-20060509/">Web Services Addressing - Core</a>
 * and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-soap-20060509/">Web Services Addressing 1.0 - SOAP Binding</a> 
 * for more information on WS-Addressing.
