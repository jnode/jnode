/**
 * Represents the declaration of a class or interface.
 * Provides access to information about the type and its members.
 * Note that an {@linkplain EnumDeclaration enum} is a kind of class,
 * and an {@linkplain AnnotationTypeDeclaration annotation type} is
 * a kind of interface.
 *
 * <p> <a name="DECL_VS_TYPE"></a>
 * While a <tt>TypeDeclaration</tt> represents the <i>declaration</i>
 * of a class or interface, a {@link DeclaredType} represents a class
 * or interface <i>type</i>, the latter being a use
 * (or <i>invocation</i>) of the former.
 * The distinction is most apparent with generic types,
 * for which a single declaration can define a whole
 * family of types.  For example, the declaration of
 * {@code java.util.Set} corresponds to the parameterized types
 * {@code java.util.Set<String>} and {@code java.util.Set<Number>}
 * (and many others), and to the raw type {@code java.util.Set}.
 *
 * <p> {@link com.sun.mirror.util.DeclarationFilter}
 * provides a simple way to select just the items of interest
 * when a method returns a collection of declarations.
