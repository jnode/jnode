        This package has classes used to generate Javadoc tag documentation. 
        Doclets no longer have to implement its own version of standard tags 
        such as &#64;param and &#64;throws.  This is the single, doclet 
        implementation of each standard tag that is shared by all
        doclets.  Each doclet must have a taglet writer that takes a taglet 
        as input and writes doclet-dependent output. The taglet itself will 
        do the tag processing. For example, suppose we are outputing
        &#64;throws tags. The taglet would:
        <ul>
            <li> Retrieve the list of throws tags to be documented.
            <li> Replace {&#64;inheritDoc} with the appropriate documentation.
            <li> Add throws documentation for exceptions that are declared in 
            	 the signature of the method but
                 not documented with the throws tags.
        </ul>
        After doing the steps above, the taglet would pass the information to 
        the taglet writer for writing. The taglets are essentially builders for 
        tags.
