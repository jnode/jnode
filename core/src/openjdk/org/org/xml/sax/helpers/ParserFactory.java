/**
 * Java-specific class for dynamically loading SAX parsers.

 * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the

 * See <a href='http://www.saxproject.org'>http://www.saxproject.org</a>
 * for further information.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This class is designed to work with the now-deprecated
 * SAX1 {@link org.xml.sax.Parser Parser} class.  SAX2 applications should use
 * {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory XMLReaderFactory} instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>ParserFactory is not part of the platform-independent definition
 * of SAX; it is an additional convenience class designed
 * specifically for Java XML application writers.  SAX applications
 * can use the static methods in this class to allocate a SAX parser
 * dynamically at run-time based either on the value of the
 * `org.xml.sax.parser' system property or on a string containing the class
 * name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the application still requires an XML parser that
 * implements SAX1.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated This class works with the deprecated
 *             {@link org.xml.sax.Parser Parser}
 *             interface.
 * @since SAX 1.0
