 * ie a GlyphMapper ought to be able to say if a code point maps to a glyph
 * IN THIS FONT, not just in this encoding.
 * Because of the current lack of distinction the NativeGlyphMapper and
 * XMap classes could be merged, however its cleaner to make them separate
 * classes so we can build caches for a particular font.
