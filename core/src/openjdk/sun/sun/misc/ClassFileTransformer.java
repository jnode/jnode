 * This is an abstract base class which is called by java.lang.ClassLoader
 * when ClassFormatError is thrown inside defineClass(). 
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to allow applications (e.g. Java Plug-in)
 * to have a chance to transform the byte code from one form to another
 * if necessary. 
 *
 * One application of this class is used by Java Plug-in to transform
 * malformed JDK 1.1 class file into a well-formed Java 2 class file
 * on-the-fly, so JDK 1.1 applets with malformed class file in the 
 * Internet may run in Java 2 after transformation.
