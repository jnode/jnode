 *         <p/>
 *         The "Buffer" is defined, in terms of offsets of bytes that
 *         have to be written to or read from the device, by the set:
 *         <p/>
 *         U = { i | offset <= i < lst }
 *         <p/>
 *         and the "Aligned Buffer", that have to be handled on the device
 *         is defined by:
 *         <p/>
 *         A = { i | start <= i < end }
 *         <p/>
 *         where
 *         <p/>
 *         start =  max { i>=0 | i <= offset, i % align = 0 }
 *         <p/>
 *         end   =  min { i>=0 | i >= lst,    i % align = 0 }
 *         <p/>
 *         "A" is the "smallest" aligned buffer that contains U, i.e.
 *         start = min(A) and end = max(A) are multiples of "align"
 *         and there are no "smallest sets" (in terms of the number
 *         of elements o(A)) that contains "U".
 *         <p/>
 *         Let me define:
 *         <p/>
 *         n = offset / align      ofsR = offset % align
 *         m = length / align      lenR = length % align
 *         q = lst    / align      lstR = lst    % align
 *         <p/>
 *         where "/" is the euclidean integer division and "%" is
 *         the euclidean integer remains (or modulo), the usual
 *         Java tokens for these operators.
 *         <p/>
 *         From the definition of Euclidean division we have:
 *         <p/>
 *         offset = n * align + ofsR   0 <= ofsR < align
 *         length = m * align + lenR   0 <= lenR < align
 *         lst    = q * align + lstR   0 <= lstR < align
 *         <p/>
 *         It is very easy to see that:
 *         <p/>
 *         start = offset - ofsR = n * align
 *         <p/>
 *         end   = lst - lstR + p * align = (n+m+k+p) * align
 *         <p/>
 *         where
 *         / 0, lstR = 0            / 0, (ofsR+lenR) < align
 *         p = |                    k = |
 *         \ 1, lstR > 0            \ 1, (ofsR+lenR) >= align
 *         <p/>
 *         The last equation come from this fact:
 *         <p/>
 *         lst = offset + length = (n+m)*align + (ofsR+lenR) =
 *         = (n+m)*align + (k*align + lstR) =
 *         = (n+m+k)*align + lstR   i.e.   q = n + m + k.
 *         <p/>
 *         Hence, the "order of A", o(A), the number of elements in A is:
 *         <p/>
 *         lA = o(A) = (end - start) = (n + m + k + p) * align
 *         <p/>
 *         and the number of "aligned blocks" in "A" is:
 *         <p/>
 *         nA = lA/align = n + m + k + p
 *         <p/>
 *         that is the "order" o(AA), of the set:
 *         <p/>
 *         AA = { i/align | i % align = 0, start <= i < end } =
 *         = { n, n+1, n+2, ..., n+m+k+p-1 }
 *         <p/>
 *         These considerations establish the basic quantities I need
 *         to correcly decide how the input buffer have to be read or
 *         written to the device, device that is supposed to be able
 *         to handle only aligned blocks, i.e. offsets and length
 *         that are intger multiples of "align".
 *         <p/>
 *         Now, we want to define what are the HEAD "H", the BODY "B" and the
 *         TAIL "T" of the "Aligned Buffer". Again they will defined as
 *         sets, "0" will be the "empty set" and we will use
 *         the notation nH=o(H), nB=o(B), nT=o(T) for the number of
 *         their elements.
 *         <p/>
 *         Let me to get rid of the "EMPTY" trivial, where nothing have to
 *         be done (length=0): we define H=0, B=0, T=0. So nB=nA=0.
 *         <p/>
 *         Although it can be handled as a "BODY" only buffer, we get
 *         rid of the "ALIGNED" trivial case too, (ofsR=0 and lstR=0),
 *         definining H=0, defining H=0, B=AA, T=0. So nB=nA=m.
 *         <p/>
 *         Anyway the EMPTY and the ALIGNED cases have to be handled
 *         separately in the code for efficiency purpouses.
 *         <p/>
 *         From now we can suppose (length>0) and (ofsR>0 or lstR>0).
 *         <p/>
 *         Again we have to handle a special case, the case where
 *         the "Buffer" is completely (and properly) "CONTAINED"
 *         inside a "single aligned block". The case is identified
 *         by the condition "lst <= start + align" and for the assumptions
 *         we have done "0 < length < align". For this case it doesn't
 *         make any sense to define HEAD, BODY and TAIL but we define
 *         as an artifact, for the sake of generality, H=0, B=0, T=0.
 *         We have "nB = 0 and nA = 1", so "nB = nA - 1".
 *         <p/>
 *         From now we can assume that "lst > start + align", i.e.
 *         the "Buffer" is "CROSSED", it "cross" the boundary of
 *         at least "one aligned block". We can now define:
 *         <p/>
 *         H =  { i/align | i not in U, i % align = 0,
 *         start <= i < start + align }
 *         <p/>
 *         B =  { i/align | i not in U, i % align = 0,
 *         start + align <= i < end - align }
 *         <p/>
 *         T =  { i/align | i not in U, i % align = 0,
 *         end - align <= i < end }
 *         <p/>
 *         It is easy to see that "AA" is the union of the mutually disjoint
 *         sets "H", "B" and "T". So "nA = nH + nB + nT" where:
 *         <p/>
 *         0 <= nH <= 1     0 <= nT <= 1    0 <= nB <= nA
 *         <p/>
 *         and that "nB = nA - nH - nT".
 *         <p/>
 *         The "Aligned Buffer" will:
 *         <p/>
 *         has an HEAD (nH=1) if and only if ofsR > 0
 *         has a  TAIL (nT=1) if and only if lstR > 0
 *         <p/>
 *         and because we excluded the "ALIGNED" case, it has to have
 *         the HEAD or the TAIL because ofsR>0 or lstR>0.
 *         <p/>
 *         As an example if the "Aligned Buffer" is CROSSED, has an HEAD,
 *         a non empty BODY and a TAIL ( k=1, p=1, m>=1 ):
 *         <p/>
 *         H = { n },  B = { n+1, n+2, ..., n+m }, T = { n+m+1 }
 *         A = { n, n+1, n+2, ..., n+m, n+m+1 }
 *         <p/>
 *         Then:
 *         / nA-1, (HEAD)    and (no TAIL), ofsR>0 and lstR>0
 *         |
 *         nB = |  nA-1, (no HEAD) and (TAIL),    ofsR=0 and lstR=0
 *         |
 *         \ nA-2, (HEAD)    and (TAIL),    ofsR>0 and lstR>0
 *         <p/>
 *         In general, using the positions we have done for the EMPTY and
 *         ALIGNED case:
 *         <p/>
 *         / nA=0, EMPTY           , length = 0
 *         |  nA=m, ALIGNED         , ofsR = 0, lstR = 0
 *         nB = |  nA-1, CONTAINED       , lst <= start + align
 *         |  nA-1, CROSSED(H)      , lst > start + align, ofsR>0, lstR=0
 *         |  nA-1, CROSSED(T)      , lst > start + align, ofsR=0, lstR>0
 *         \ nA-2, CROSSED(HT)     , lst > start + align, ofsR
 *         <p/>
 *         Now you can ask "why all of this semi math stuff?" ... ;-) ...
 *         well it helps ... believe me ... it actually is a "proof" that
 *         the code inside the "BufferType" inner class does a correct job ...
 *         I hope ... the constructor of the helper "BufferType" class
 *         uses the "(offset,length)" couple to compute some of this
 *         quantities and use them to decide if the "Buffer" at the given
 *         offset is EMPTY, ALIGNED, CONTAINED or CROSSED and correctly
 *         compute nB for all the cases.
 *         <p/>
 *         The code of the "read", "write" methods uses the type of the
 *         buffer, ofsR, lstR and nB to decide how it has to
 *         handle the "alignment" of the blocks.
 *         <p/>
 *         Infact, speaking roughly, beside the trivial "EMPTY", "ALIGNED" cases
 *         and the "CONTAINED" case, in the general "CROSSED" case we can optimize
 *         read and write for "BODY" of the buffer. We cannot do anything for
 *         the CONTAINED case and for the HEAD and the TAIL of the buffer.
 *         <p/>
 *         The basic idea is to reduce the number of "buffercopy" (read method)
 *         and the number of "read/buffercopy" (write method) to the minimum
 *         possible number (that actually is nA-nB). At most it will "buffercopy"
 *         or "read/buffercopy" 2 blocks (because 0<=nA-nB<=2).
 *         <p/>
 *         Hope this long comment will help to understand and verify the code
 *         and to understand how bad my brain is working ... ;-) ...
 *         <p/>
