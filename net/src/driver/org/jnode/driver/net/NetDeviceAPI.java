 * <h3>Transmission</h3>
 * To transmit data, each network device should has a queue of Frame's.
 * The transmit method is called to add a frame to this queue. The device
 * should start a worker thread to process this queue.
 * Once a frame has been transmitted, the notifyTransmission method of that
 * frame must be called.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Reception</h3>
 * On reception of a frame, a network device must call the receive
 * method of the NetworkLayerManager.
