/**
 * This interface is JNode's command stream API.  The purpose of the
 * API is to allow commands to gain access the "standard" streams as either
 * byte oriented Input/OutputStreams or character oriented Readers/Writers,
 * while hiding the underlying implementation.  This API will also support 
 * more specialized functions such as testing if the channel is a 'tty' stream 
 * (in the UNIX sense.)
 * <p>
 * A CommandIO instance is a unidirectional or bidirectional data channel holder.
 * It provides a number of getters that reify the channel as a character or byte 
 * oriented stream using the standard Java APIs.  These getters should return 
 * objects that preserve the correct order of data read and written, irrespective
 * of whether flush is called explicitly or implicitly.
