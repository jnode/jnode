/**
 * This class provides a buffered byte-stream pipeline implementation that 
 * supports multiple sources and sinks.  The pipeline has a finite buffer,
 * so a thread that reads and writes to the same pipeline risks deadlock.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the standard Piped* classes,
 * Pipeline and its related classes do not try to detect dead pipes based
 * on exit of threads.  Instead, a pipeline shuts down when the sources
 * are closed, or when {@link #shutdown()} method called.  
 * <p>
 * The intended lifecycle of a Pipeline is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A Pipeline object is instantiated.</li>
 * <li>One or more sources and sinks are created using {@link #createSource()}
 *     and {@link #createSink()}.
 * <li>The Pipeline is activated by calling {@link #activate()}.
 * <li>Data is written to the pipeline sources and read from the sinks.
 * <li>The pipeline sources are closed, causing the pipeline to shut down cleanly.
 *     Read calls on the sinks will return any remaining buffered data and then
 *     signal EOF in the normal way.
 * <li>The sinks are closed, and the Pipeline is shutdown.
 * </ol>
